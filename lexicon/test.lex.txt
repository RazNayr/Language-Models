<s> in sum then while acknowledging the stature of some elements of this constellation such as the historical aspects of foucault s work or the critical élan of fredric jameson not to mention the giant figure of habermas callinicos develops a root and branch assault on claims for the cultural distinction of the postmodern for the conceptual adequacy of its theoretical base and above all for the deleterious political consequences of adherence to it </s>
<s> so far so good or one might almost say so unproblematic </s>
<s> callinicos mobilises as powerful a body of argument and evidence as is readily conceivable against a variety of contemporary critics and theorists whose claims he sees with justice as a trahison des clercs </s>
<s> the principal weakness of both the modernist tradition proper and indeed of nietzsche himself is for callinicos their aestheticism </s>
<s> it is as well to be clear on this </s>
<s> at this point callinicos has to be careful it is one thing to dismiss the claims of a rootless postmodernism wandering naked except for its designer trainers across the face of a barren late capitalism </s>
<s> this is principally indexed to the claimed historical transformation of modernism into a series of engaged avantgardes dedicated not to the aestheticisation of life but to the integration of art into life </s>
<s> the avantgarde here means of course constructivism surrealism and a range of weimar practices grouped by callinicos somewhat misleadingly under the label neue sachlichkeit </s>

<s> for callinicos this is unquestionable as is the fact that the shift is enabled by the bolshevik revolution of 1917 </s>

<s> callinicos drives a coach and horses through postmodernism well and good </s>
<s> i shall conclude briefly </s>
<s> the point is i think that the argument from here can go two ways </s>
<s> callinicos defence of marxism is erudite and compelling and the fact that he runs out of steam over postwar art is of less moment than the fact that he takes the range of issues seriously enough to discuss them at all </s>
<s> most sociologists economists and politicians after all do nt get that far </s>
<s> good art can be produced in an immense variety of different conditions p 161 </s>
<s> of course the whole thrust of the historic avantgarde and particularly its celebration here lies in its being associated with a liberation from bourgeois ideology but this is not quite the same as having your revolutionary commitments tested by your aesthetic judgement </s>
<s> a work can only be politically correct if it is also literarily correct </s>

<s> however newton s theory of light and colours first published in 1672 and extended in his opticks 1704 provided a new direction for colour theorists </s>
<s> such a brief summary does not do justice to the detail and complexity of kemp s argument </s>
<s> the difficulty is most apparent when discussing the renaissance since by hypostatising science and art as two separate and separable activities kemp is framing a problem that did not exist for the historical actors </s>
<s> again how were science and art demarcated in the early fifteenth century socially intellectually and institutionally </s>
<s> for example in his appraisal of the eighteenth century he uses scientific and newtonian as predicates to create the impression of an hypostasised activity which stood separate from art and other aspects of western culture including philosophy </s>
<s> although taylor was active in the royal society both predicates misrepresent this english gentleman who wrote extensively on mathematics and religion </s>
<s> this is in one sense unobjectionable and kemp rightly weighs the evidence for influence circumspectly </s>
<s> again kemp s subject raises important questions about the structure and function of institutions which he only engages parenthetically </s>
<s> another example of a terminological difficulty arises in the section in which kemp briefly examines the relation between perspective and eighteenthcentury theories of perception </s>
<s> unfortunately he predicates his discussion on the contrast between empiricists and nativists a distinction he soon recognises as inadequate </s>
<s> while he has usefully identified theories of perception as an aspect of the science of art they deserve a more eclectic and sustained analysis </s>
<s> in their art they combined perspective with drawing by eye they instinctively knew when to follow the rules and when to break them </s>
<s> one of the most forceful attacks was by george berkeley in his an essay towards a new theory of vision 1709 </s>
<s> here berkeley argued strenuously against the view that we judge the distance of objects by means of lines and angles </s>
<s> berkeley was familiar with perspective machines one of which he described in a later work </s>
<s> attacks on geometricallybased theories of vision together with the deployment of such examples as the horizontal moon illusion provide a theme of common concern to artists scientists and philosophers and deserve further analysis than kemp offers </s>
<s> in the history of science theoria has usually been accorded far greater importance than praxis </s>
<s> the general view has been that theoria is the engine driving the historical development of science and that praxis is merely the application of theoria </s>
<s> although some historians often marxists have rejected this consensus only recently have aspects of praxis such as laboratory skills been subjected to close and sustained study </s>
<s> the latter case is the more straightforward since he presents the impact of newton s theory of coloured light as radically reorientating this area </s>
<s> kepler s concern with the formation of images was a response to a practical problem </s>
<s> in his resolution of the problem kepler represented his rays by strings </s>
<s> for example in ascertaining the image of a book on a distant plane he adopted a procedure familiar to artists for almost a century </s>
<s> he also argues that in its turn the scientific revolution had some effect on the visual arts </s>
<s> military engineers who were also often mathematicians such as simon stevin and girard desargues contributed significantly to the subject of perspective </s>
<s> by the eighteenth century there was a considerable parting of the ways since the more erudite mathematical treatises on perspective such as those by lambert and monge were of no use to the practising artist </s>

<s> if this statement betrays a certain uneasiness it is perhaps not surprising given the subversive status of the situationist project and their condemnation of the art world </s>

<s> to the extent that the situationists raised questions about cultural hierarchies and the supersession of art how should we judge the fallout period </s>
<s> it seems extraordinary that given the political fervour of the parisbased si fraction in its postlettrist phase the exhibition should have been so solemnly organised with little regard to debord s caveat on auteurism and his contempt for the art market </s>
<s> the contradiction is perhaps a familiar one </s>
<s> at the centre of the regrouped si in 1961 bernstein and debord refused any separation between artistic and political activity </s>
<s> it was at this time that asgerjorn resigned his membership of the si although he continued to finance it through the sale of his paintings which were increasingly in demand in the 1960s </s>
<s> nevertheless wollen presents a lucid account of the movement in its formative period and makes an interesting case for andré breton as a figure of some distinction in french intellectual history </s>
<s> the main purpose of levin s article however is to reclaim debord for the aesthetic discourse of avantgarde cinema </s>
<s> for example he identifies debord as the source of godard s innovations indeed well over a decade before godard s vent dest debord was producing a revolutionary materialist countercinema </s>
<s> not having seen debord s films he refused screenings at the ica in london levin s arguments are in one sense untestable nevertheless the article is not without difficulties </s>
<s> both the personality and the work remain famously obscure in a way which seems almost contrived </s>
<s> an example of this is the early lettrist film hurlement en faveur de sade with its long periods of blank screen and extended silences </s>
<s> in the opening sequence of hurlement as levin notes debord provides the audience with a reference to a cinematic tradition in which his own work is putatively situated </s>
<s> moreover levin claims that the situationists never lost sight of their own contradictions by consenting to act in culture as a precondition of their coexistence in the present order </s>
<s> nevertheless cinema ultimately retains a relative autonomy in levin s tribute </s>
<s> debord s apparent contempt for audiences has its counterpart in levin s emphasis upon origination and prestige as paradigms of his cultural history </s>
<s> suffice it to say that this discourse is generalising and intemperate and lacks depth and clarity </s>
<s> debord for example proclaims the critical position later elaborated by the situationists has shown that the suppression and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single supersession of art </s>
<s> in levin s account of debord his subject appears to hold both positions at once </s>
<s> the si thus rejected mechanical becoming with its notions of progress merit and causal succession </s>
<s> he does this by proclaiming a third avantgarde which avoids the major pitfalls of the two avantgardes and secures some theoretical authority for debord </s>
<s> the political and philosophical origins of situationist thought to a large degree derives from marx s critique of alienation and commodity fetishism lukács s development of this critique and the marxistexistentialism of sartre and henri lefebvre </s>
<s> the simple faith conveyed in pannekoek s treatise recalls earlier utopian writing and contrasts with the strident and acerbic tone of situationist writing </s>
<s> the revival of interest in its ideas might be explained by this rather than by its standing as a political organisation </s>
<s> its reemergence as spectacle relates more visibly to its cult status and the nostalgic allure of fifties paris a marginalised and dissolute existence in the company of exotic friends and of romantic places with beautiful names </s>
<s> the short commentaries and comic imagery in the british section of the scrapbook are largely printed ephemera with unserious political pretensions </s>
<s> some of it is amusing some of it pretentious drivel </s>
<s> the temptation is to view these publications and the exhibition as a proliferation of surfaces which are in a sense pretty vacant reminders that despite the essentially teleological nature of the situationist project it is now immobilised and its documents merely a contribution to culture as the spectacular remains of an abandoned revolutionary ideal </s>
<s> the belligerence of their message and the violence of their appeal to negation and revolt is now passed over in silence and their works appear as if they were blank sheets to the privileged audiences of the present day </s>
<s> firstly art language s piece ralph the situationist expresses considerable misgivings about the situationist project the texts are effectively incorrigible and self insulating bland incoherence a selfcontradictory absurdity a moral ground to give up reading and remembering and so on </s>
<s> on what basis is this reference made </s>
<s> there was no such connection </s>
<s> nowhere in these publications are these connections argued for they are merely dogmatically asserted </s>
<s> given the withering contempt expressed by the situationists for prositus one shudders to think what debord et al </s>

<s> their quest was for the perfect formula </s>
<s> the critique of scientific socialism and economism has a major place in marxist debate in the twentieth century </s>
<s> the situationists contribution to this was negligible </s>
<s> for other theorists such as william morris the concept of work is not considered negatively </s>
<s> lukács claimed that labour became the model for any social practice </s>
<s> the plea for an understanding of totality in situationist writing derives from lukács and marx whose critique of separation is directed exactly at the workleisure distinction </s>

<s> murder manslaughter and several other offences are discussed and one recurrent issue here is whether english law responds proportionately to the different degrees of culpability manifested in cases where death is caused </s>
<s> there are still awkward questions to be confronted </s>
<s> another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider in its application to activities which carry some risk of causing death than in other spheres </s>
<s> the requirements of causation in the criminal law are discussed elsewhere </s>

<s> as for public protection this depends on executive decisions with regard to release it fails to take into account whether it is necessary for public protection to keep lifers in for so long </s>
<s> at present the executive takes decisions to release some murderers after only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely long periods </s>

<s> such a reform would bring improvements in natural justice without loss of public protection </s>

<s> d maintained throughout that he had not intended to kill but there was evidence from which the jury could infer and did infer that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm </s>
<s> if one person chooses to cause serious injury to another it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life as to warrant the label murder if death results </s>
<s> of course one can not be adamant about whether they merit the label murder because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter which is not susceptible of any precise resolution </s>
<s> the fault element for many serious offences is intent or recklessness why should this not suffice for murder </s>
<s> to classify all reckless killings as murder might be too broad but the point remains that some reckless killings may be thought no less heinous than intentional killings </s>

<s> a third more precise formulation derives from the recommendations of the criminal law revision committee in 1980 namely that a killing should be classified as murder in those situations where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death </s>
<s> neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness as to death should be sufficient on its own but together they restrict one another producing a test which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and marks out some heinous but nonintended killings </s>

<s> the law must resort to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify and separate out the most heinous killings </s>
<s> some of the people thus covered would be armed robbers others would be terrorists </s>
<s> the armed robber might say that he had no intention of using the firearm that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim and that it went off accidentally if the jury believes that should he be convicted of murder </s>
<s> i the subjective requirement </s>
<s> it is one thing to exclude cases like ibrams from the defence the gap of some five days between provocation and killing savours of considered revenge it is another thing to exclude defendants with slowburning temperaments who do not react straight away to an insult or wrong but go away and then react after hours of festering anger </s>
<s> these restrictions show that the subjective element is merely preparing the ground for the objective element it is not part of a broader defence of emotional pressure of the kind discussed in chapter 65c above </s>
<s> ii the objective condition </s>
<s> this is english law s rather clumsy attempt to reflect the element of partial justification in the doctrine of provocation </s>
<s> the underlying point is that it is not every act of provocation which should be allowed to reduce murder to manslaughter but only those serious enough to unbalance the behaviour of a person with reasonable selfcontrol </s>
<s> camplin 1978 </s>
<s> the underlying idea is that citizens are expected to keep control over their behaviour but that in circumstances where even a person of normal selfcontrol might be provoked the offence may be reduced from murder to manslaughter </s>
<s> to modify the standard where d is very young camplin was 15 is understandable it is not fair to expect a youth to show the same level of selfrestraint as an adult </s>
<s> clearly sex may be a relevant characteristic in some cases for some provocations are specific to one sex but is there an argument for different standards of selfcontrol for males and females </s>
<s> this counterargument has been given some recognition by the courts in that the reasonable relationship rule is no longer a rule of law </s>
<s> if that is the underlying proposition it is important to dissociate it from the unacceptable idea that a person s acts after loss of selfcontrol should still be measured on an objective scale </s>
<s> if the explanation for the violent outburst lies in something which might understandably lead a person to be so angry as to lose selfcontrol then this supplies an added reason for mitigating the offence and the sentence </s>
<s> however the significant reduction in sentence is probably connected with the normative elements in the provocation doctrine the elements of partial justification </s>
<s> their lordships devoted little of their speeches to the possibility of allowing duress to function as a qualified defence to murder reducing the crime to manslaughter and leaving the judge to pass an appropriate sentence </s>
<s> however the house of lords preferred to see a conviction for murder in these cases with the use of executive discretion to secure an early release from the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for offenders who killed when under duress and thus appear to have reduced culpability </s>
<s> the normative requirements of the defence of duress discussed in detail in chapter 64 ensure that it is restricted to dire and realistic threats which a citizen of reasonable firmness could not be expected to resist </s>
<s> if murder is to be reserved for those homicides which are most deserving of stigma this does not seem to be one of them </s>
<s> third in some cases the defendant acts instinctively in response to an unexpected situation completely misjudging the proper reactions in the heat of the moment this is a similar reason to the second but adds the element of emotional disturbance which may explain the overreaction in certain cases </s>
<s> both the second and more strongly the third reason show that the doctrine of excessive defence may include a substantial element of excuse in its rationale even though its theoretical foundation lies unmistakably in the concept of legal justification </s>
<s> the phenomenon is a relatively recent one since diminished responsibility was only introduced into english law in 1957 in response to longstanding dissatisfaction with the insanity defence </s>
<s> insanity was and still is a complete defence to crime as we saw in chapter 62 above but its confines are narrow and some persons obviously suffering from mental disorder came to be sentenced to death for murder before 1957 </s>
<s> a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal </s>
<s> section 2 does require that the abnormality of mind should be one arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury but this range of admissible causes is sufficiently general to encourage a broad construction of the defence </s>
<s> in practice it has been taken as allowing the jury to assess whether the mental abnormality was such a significant factor in the killing as to reduce ds culpability to the extent that the offence should be reduced from murder to manslaughter </s>
<s> if such a defence were available in murder cases and the consequence of a successful plea would be to give the court a limited discretion as to the order to be made the case for a separate doctrine of diminished responsibility would be weak </s>
<s> the butler committee argued that relatively minor mental disorders may be regarded as falling within section 2 simply because this outcome is thought to be preferable to mandatory life imprisonment </s>
<s> by the infanticide act 1922 parliament mitigated the application of the law of murder to mothers who killed their newborn babies whilst suffering from the effects of childbirth </s>
<s> the maximum penalty remains life imprisonment although almost all the cases each year twenty or so are dealt with noncustodially usually by a probation order </s>
<s> in their evidence to the criminal law revision committee the royal college of psychiatrists pressed for legal recognition of these wider social and situational factors </s>
<s> a suicide pact exists where two or more people each having a settled intention of dying reach an agreement which has as its object the death of both or all </s>
<s> this may be said to amount to a mutual exercise of the individuals rights of selfdetermination </s>
<s> the criminal law revision committee regarded this bending of the law as unsatisfactory and tentatively proposed a new offence of mercy killing where a person out of compassion unlawfully kills another who is or is believed by him to be permanently helpless or in great pain </s>
<s> yet recognition of that extension might at the same time open up the possibility that vulnerable people who do not desire death despite their suffering might be killed by others for reasons of their own this would subvert the right to selfdetermination and is an argument against a mercykilling defence or offence </s>
<s> our discussion has taken a broad view of qualified defences commenting also on some qualified defences which might be recognized but which do not feature in contemporary english law </s>
<s> the jury would have no role in this the judge would derive no assistance from their verdict </s>
<s> one possibility would be to evolve a qualified defence of killing under extreme emotional disturbance following the lead of the model penal code </s>
<s> this might encompass all those qualified defences with an element of excuse in them </s>
<s> one disadvantage of the change might be that the more precise moral distinctions currently incorporated within the law would become submerged within the sentencing discretion where the signposts are less clear and the arguments less structured </s>
<s> this might be the case with provocation for example there may be objections to some of the distinctions now drawn by the law of provocation but a broader defence of extreme emotional disturbance might provide for reduction of the offence in cases of loss of selfcontrol when caring for a baby or when arrested by a policeofficer known to be acting lawfully and some might feel that there are strong arguments against this </s>
<s> such a reformulated qualified defence would not encompass cases of excessive selfdefence since they may involve a genuine and unhurried misjudgment of the amount of force permissible and so they would have to be the subject of a separate qualified defence </s>
<s> the category of killings which has come to be known as involuntary manslaughter has nothing to do with involuntariness properly so called </s>
<s> these are cases where death has been caused with insufficient fault to justify labelling it as murder but with sufficient fault for a manslaughter verdict </s>
<s> can this be justified by reference to the magnitude of the harm resulting ie death </s>
<s> another problem is the more general one of liability for negligence as we saw in chapter 53 f this is regarded as insufficient for liability for most serious offences and yet it may be sufficient for manslaughter </s>
<s> is it right that liability for the second most heinous crime in english law which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment should be satisfied by this relatively low grade of fault </s>
<s> this species of involuntary manslaughter is based upon constructive liability </s>
<s> let us examine each of these requirements in turn </s>
<s> if the unlawful act is arson criminal damage by fire the fault element will be intention or caldwell recklessness and the latter does not require any subjective awareness on the defendant s part </s>
<s> the reasons for excluding crimes of negligence were stated in </s>
<s> dpp 1937 where a driver had killed a pedestrian whilst overtaking another car </s>
<s> once it has been established that d was committing a criminal offence the second step is to establish that this caused the death </s>
<s> in most cases of battery or actual bodily harm the causal connection will be plain but cases involving drugs have presented difficulties </s>
<s> the court of appeal held that the supplying was insufficient as an unlawful act because it was not directed at v subsequent decisions are unclear whether the directed at test remains good law and a better approach to the facts of dalby would be to hold that the supplying of drugs did not cause the death because v took them himself </s>
<s> this was seen as a slight restriction of the doctrine when it was imposed in church 1966 where the court held that the unlawful act must be such as all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognize must subject the other person to at least the risk of some harm resulting therefrom albeit not serious harm </s>
<s> it will be seen that this is the caldwelllawrence formula for recklessness analysed in chapter 53 c and is virtually the same as the test for the separate offence of causing death by reckless driving </s>
<s> in bateman 1925 where a doctor had attended the confinement of a woman who died whilst giving birth the court of criminal appeal held that there must be negligence over and above that which is sufficient to establish civil liability and which shows such disregard for the life and safety of others as to deserve punishment </s>
<s> this was not always so in senior 1899 a man who belonged to a religious sect called the peculiar people refused to call a doctor to his child who subsequently died he was held guilty of manslaughter on the ground that he had committed an unlawful act wilful neglect of the child which caused death </s>
<s> however this very reasoning was abjured in lowe 1973 where d failed to ensure that medical help was summoned to his child and it died </s>
<s> the court of appeal held that a manslaughter verdict would not necessarily follow from a conviction for wilful neglect </s>
<s> this passage suggests that the law should and does draw a distinction between the blameworthiness of acts and omissions even where the omission is deliberate </s>
<s> the defendant must be proved to have been indifferent to an obvious risk of injury to health or actually to have foreseen the risk but to have determined nevertheless to run it </s>
<s> if the caldwell test of recklessness does indeed apply then this form of omissions liability could be assimilated within the general doctrine of manslaughter by recklessness </s>
<s> the english law of manslaughter exhibits a tension between various principles of fairness to the defendant and the significance of the harm caused </s>
<s> reckless manslaughter is also an example of constructive liability even if caldwell recklessness is justifiable as a standard it is only an obvious risk of injury which must have been foreseeable </s>
<s> surely to apply the label manslaughter to the conduct of a person who envisaged no more than a common assault e g by a single punch is both disproportionate and unfair </s>
<s> to support manslaughter liability in these cases one would have to espouse the draconian principle that a person should be held liable for all the consequences of any wrongful act </s>
<s> a refusal to espouse that principle is perhaps the only ground on which the omissions cases see 75d above can be defended since their distinction between acts and omissions is unconvincing </s>
<s> these risks are widely known distinguished as much by the possibility of one or several deaths occurring as by the frequency with which the risk materializes </s>
<s> it also fails to substantiate the claim that deathcausing acts or omissions in these situations of known danger should fall within the law of manslaughter rather than some other offence </s>
<s> some less culpable forms of bad driving might also be labelled reckless such as a momentary dozingoff at the wheel or the failure to notice a pedestrian on a crossing </s>
<s> an obvious risk of property damage alone is insufficient for manslaughter but may suffice for the driving offences </s>
<s> ever since the offence of causing death by reckless driving was introduced it formerly included causing death by dangerous driving too there have been those who have pointed to its illogicality </s>
<s> there is a wellknown risk in motoring that certain kinds of driving may cause accidents and that accidents may cause death </s>
<s> there is however another dimension to the debate and this appears from the clrc s view that where reckless driving causes death this should not affect the label of the offence but may be treated as an aggravating factor in sentencing in appropriate cases </s>
<s> this assumes that there is a tension between the causing of serious harm death and the relatively low fault recklessness as here defined and that this tension should be resolved in favour of the fault element when we are deciding on the labels of offences thereby making no reference to the result but should be resolved in favour of the serious harm when sentencing increasing the sentence according to the gravity of the resulting harm </s>
<s> much depends on the social function of labelling criminal offences and on the particular labels chosen </s>
<s> we are referring here to the offence of causing death by reckless driving not to manslaughter </s>
<s> it is therefore one may assume a label of intermediate stigma falling short of the stigma attached to the offence of manslaughter </s>
<s> as for sentencing english courts have been unclear about the proper approach </s>
<s> however there are other decisions which have taken account of unexpected and chance results as aggravating factors </s>
<s> it will therefore be seen that many of the issues involved here are similar to those raised by the law of involuntary manslaughter save for the fact that driving offences constitute deviations from a code of conduct on which all persons are tested before they are granted drivinglicences </s>
<s> the main thrust of the explosives act 1883 however is contained in the offences of causing an explosion likely to endanger life section 2 and the possession of explosives with intent to endanger life section 3 </s>
<s> section 19 penalises possession of a loaded firearm in a public place presumably in circumstances where the section 16 offence can not be proved but on the argument that the mere possession is sufficiently dangerous because accidents can happen with loaded guns and the consequences might be lifeendangering </s>
<s> offences relating to the operation of aircraft ships and railways have not been prominent in the practice of english criminal law </s>
<s> it is true that over the years a few railway signalmen have been convicted of manslaughter for wrongful acts and omissions leading to fatal train crashes but there is not the natural resort to the criminal law which is now a feature of roadtraffic cases </s>
<s> in a sense greater values are at stake in the operation of aircraft ships and railways because many lives are involved more than would normally be risked by the bad driving of a motor vehicle although there is an important exception here in the operation of buses and coaches which are more akin to planes boats and trains </s>
<s> a company s management policies might be just as much to blame for a particular accident as the actions of the driver pilot or captain sheen j made this point in his report on the zeebrugge ferry disaster but english prosecution practice has tended not to invoke the criminal law against managers of transport systems </s>
<s> one might well ask how important the element of criminal damage is to the rationale of the aggravated offence </s>
<s> its great merit is that it is not confined to particular activities and therefore has an acrosstheboard application to different sources of endangerment </s>
<s> in this chapter we shall be discussing two main forms of physical violation the use of physical force and sexual assaults </s>
<s> given that it would be unsatisfactory to have a single offence then the question is how best to divide up the forms and degrees of physical violation and of sexual assault </s>
<s> we shall look first at physical violation </s>
<s> the general term sexual assault is used here to include nonconsensual sexual offences there are various forms of sexual activity which are criminal even if they are indulged in consensually by adults of sound mind and there was a brief discussion of these in chapter 21 and 24 b </s>
<s> between 1974 and 1984 the rise was 72 per cent slightly above that for all recorded offences 69 per cent </s>
<s> but the first point remains and means that the special rules relating to fault and intoxication discussed in chapter 63 come into play </s>
<s> the value of privacy is central here the body is part of one s private identity and apart from any physical hurt inflicted by violence a violent assault constitutes a challenge to one s personal identity peace and wellbeing </s>
<s> how should it respond to these various invasions of physical integrity a quality which is highly valued by most citizens </s>
<s> thorough reform of the law is long overdue </s>
<s> the fault element for attempted murder is therefore high higher than for murder under english law since murder may be committed by someone who merely intended to cause really serious injury and not death </s>
<s> section 18 of the offences against the person act 1861 creates a serious offence which may be committed in a number of different ways </s>
<s> there are two alternative forms of conduct and either of two forms of intent will suffice </s>
<s> where the prosecution fails to establish intention the offence will be reduced to the lower category to be considered in section 83 c below so long as recklessness is proved </s>
<s> considerable attention has been focused on the distinction between causing grievous bodily harm section 18 and inflicting grievous bodily harm section 20 for many years it was believed that the more restrictive word inflict meant that section 20 required proof of a sufficiently direct action by d to constitute an assault but the house of lords has now decided that there can be an infliction of gbh without proof of an assault </s>
<s> section 18 requires intention </s>
<s> one is assault with intent to rob which like robbery carries a maximum of life imprisonment it is in effect an offence of attempted robbery </s>
<s> however in practice the courts tend to impose higher sentences for assaults on the police and it is therefore worth noting that this offence is committed even though d was unaware that he was striking a policeofficer </s>
<s> as blackstone put it the law can not draw the line between different degrees of violence and therefore totally prohibits the first and lowest stage of it every man s person being sacred and no other having a right to meddle with it in any the slightest manner </s>
<s> there are a number of disputed points about the ambit of the offence of battery </s>
<s> there is no clear decision on whether battery can be committed by the indirect application of force by digging a hole into which people subsequently fall for example but there are judicial statements in favour of including indirect force </s>
<s> d proceeded to scratch the police officer s arm having previously made it clear in colourful language that she did not wish to talk to the police officer </s>
<s> the key issue here was ds obvious refusal of consent to any touching in other cases there might be a general issue of whether the touching goes beyond generally acceptable standards of conduct </s>
<s> the essence of the crime of assault as distinct from battery is that it involves an apprehension of the immediate application of unlawful force </s>
<s> another disputed issue concerns the ambit of immediacy </s>
<s> in one case the divisional court held that assault was committed where a woman was frightened by the sight of a man looking in through the window of her house although there seems to have been little suggestion that the man was threatening to apply force either immediately or at all </s>
<s> it is a different matter if d intends to cause and does cause v to apprehend the immediate application of force in a case where none is objectively likely eg the gun which d points at v is a toy </s>
<s> the owner of property can consent to someone destroying or damaging that property </s>
<s> we shall see below that consent may constitute the difference between the sexual expression of shared love between two people and the serious offence of rape </s>
<s> if a person wishes to give up his physical integrity in certain circumstances or to risk it for the sake of sport or excitement should the criminal law allow the consent to negative what would otherwise be a crime </s>
<s> the court of appeal was asked to rule on this question in attorneygeneral s reference no </s>
<s> these apparent exceptions can be justified as involving the exercise of a legal right in the case of chastisement or correction or as needed in the public interest in the other cases </s>
<s> if we bring the argument back to consent to nonfatal physical harm we may recall that the lord chief justice relied on the phrase not in the public interest to justify the restrictions </s>
<s> one reason that he ruled out was the argument derived from earlier cases that fights in public should be prohibited because they tend to create disorder </s>
<s> such laws are partly paternalistic based on the argument that the state is in a better position to assess the risks of injury and partly economic in the sense that conformity with the law would save millions of pounds in medical expenses as well as much grief for citizens </s>
<s> a further paternalistic argument is that a law restricting consent helps to protect individual citizens from themselves by counteracting some of the social pressures and shame which might otherwise occur </s>
<s> on the other hand the extent to which judicial decisions can influence patterns of social behaviour must remain an open question </s>
<s> second there should be constant reappraisal of the suitability of certain forms of sport </s>
<s> the question of positive contribution raises again the issue of the social worth of sport recreation and dangerous exhibitions </s>
<s> the law of conspiracy is aimed at group offending but conviction depends on proof of some prior agreement </s>
<s> the law of complicity enables the conviction of people who aid and abet others to commit offences and spreads a fairly wide net in doing so </s>
<s> however the law of complicity is technical and the 1986 public order act is a response to the call for a simplified and more practical scheme of offences for dealing with public disorder </s>
<s> thus the act goes a long way in smoothing the path of the prosecutor </s>
<s> this not only removes the need for the prosecutor to prove this element but also removes part of the rationale for the offences </s>
<s> this argument comes close to a constitutional paradox that people who are protesting against the fairness of the political system may find themselves convicted of serious offences because their mode of protest is a realistic one </s>
<s> there ought to be a right to protest in public it might be argued and where the bona fide exercise of this right happens to lead to some form of disorder it is wrong to visit the perpetrators with severe sanctions </s>
<s> and yet there remains the fact noted at the outset that the act applies to violence and violent threats in private </s>
<s> would this strengthen the case for a set of offences skewed towards the prosecution </s>
<s> it seems likely that a redefinition of the principal crimes of physical violation would cover most of these cases anyway and the criminal law revision committee saw the need to supplement the general offences with only one special offence administering to another without his consent any substance which d knows to be capable of interfering substantially with the other s bodily functions </s>
<s> it consists essentially of wilfully assaulting illtreating neglecting abandoning or exposing a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health </s>
<s> the mental health act 1983 contains a somewhat similar offence of illtreating or wilfully neglecting a patient in a mental hospital which has a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment </s>
<s> although they are no less lethal than firearms in their potential to cause injury or even death their considerable social utility indeed the dependence of much social interaction on them indicates the need for a different approach </s>
<s> that approach consists of a code of good practice the highway code a requirement that drivers pass a qualifying test and a network of offences to penalize those who deviate from proper standards </s>
<s> during the 1980s there was evidence of harsher punishments being handed out to reckless drivers and of a wider appreciation of the risks created and the misery inflicted by deviations from proper standards of driving </s>
<s> the question of endangerment has already been raised in a more general fashion in chapter 77 </s>
<s> the advantage would be that the law would move closer towards proportionality based on degree of harm and degree of risk untrammelled by conventional views of what does and what does not count as crime </s>
<s> the crimes in the 1861 act form a somewhat shakily constructed ladder with rather more overlapping of offences and elements of constructive liability than is necessary </s>
<s> first what is the meaning of injury </s>
<s> reported rapes have increased considerably in the 1980s but it is difficult to tell to what extent this represents a real increase in the number of rapes or an increase in the reporting of them </s>
<s> another serious offence is buggery intercourse per anum but that constitutes a crime whether committed consensually or nonconsensually and it is the nonconsensual form which ranks as a serious sexual assault </s>
<s> many of the other forms of sexual assault on males or females do not take the form of sexual intercourse as defined in the offences of rape and buggery and english law classifies these as indecent assaults </s>
<s> then there is a group of offences which prohibit sexual activities with young people whether they appear to consent or not whilst there is little dispute about the need for some such offences there is room for disagreement on the proper boundaries of the criminal law and on the role of prosecutorial discretion </s>
<s> since these values are high among those which the criminal law ought to respect no further demonstration of this startingpoint is necessary </s>
<s> is respect for sexual choice any more important than respect for another s property rights </s>
<s> the answer to this requires us to assess the relative centrality of sexual choice to life choices and living standards </s>
<s> thus even where a sexual assault involves no significant physical force it constitutes harm in the sense that it invades a deeply personal zone gaining nonconsensually that which should only be shared consensually </s>
<s> to alter this cluster of attitudes to one in which sexuality is seen as an expression of an equal sharing relationship will require a widespread change in social attitudes through education and other media </s>
<s> it is perhaps in recognition of the awkward position of english law that exceptions have been made to the maritalrape exemption in recent years </s>
<s> however these particular instances do not meet the general proposition that if the husband and wife have drifted apart and the woman has made it known that she no longer wants to have sex with her husband it is wrong that the husband who has sex with her without her consent is exempt from conviction for rape </s>
<s> the defence argument was that this was a preliminary to conventional intercourse and that if the husband was exempt from liability for rape he should equally be exempt from liability for indecent assault </s>
<s> these fundamental values should not be jettisoned simply because marriage is a factor in the case as indeed the court of appeal affirmed when holding that a husband may be convicted of kidnapping his wife </s>
<s> how might the argument run </s>
<s> the answer is that it does and that the justifications for doing so have been set out above not so much because rape is a serious offence but rather because ascertainment of the facts is so easy that there should be little substantive unfairness to defendants </s>
<s> if the criminal law is to impose further duties on citizens it is important to take account of the legality principles particularly the principle of maximum certainty see chapter 33 i and g </s>
<s> changing the law on mistake in rape could help to change these social attitudes even though for some time to come defendants might find themselves charged with rape because of such ingrained attitudes towards women </s>
<s> one of the many reactions to the decision of the house of lords in caldwell 1982 was that it went against dpp v </s>
<s> since the identity of one s sexual partner may be assumed to be of fundamental significance it is surely unjustified to give effect to this only where the mistake concerns whether the man is the woman s husband </s>
<s> similarly if d knowingly takes advantage of the fact that v is labouring under a mistaken belief in order to have sex with her when as he realises she probably would not consent otherwise should this not be sufficient </s>
<s> however there are both practical and legal problems in cases where the woman says that she consented through fear only she did not resist because she thought that it would be hopeless in the circumstances she was terrified or she feared serious violence </s>
<s> thus the jury should be instructed that the term consent covers a whole range of situations from actual desire to reluctant acquiescence and that the dividing line between real consent and mere submission must be drawn by the jury by applying its knowledge of human nature to the facts of the case </s>
<s> the narrowest position is to say that rape is committed only where d threatens violence or knows that v is in fear of violence and that any other threat must fall within the lesser offence of procuring sex by threats </s>
<s> these questions will be considered on a broader canvas in section 87 below </s>
<s> so far the discussion has focused on the offence of rape in english law which is confined to cases of sexual intercourse where the penis penetrates the vagina </s>
<s> one of the circumstances constituting this offence is where the penis penetrate the anus of a male or a female and the maximum penalty is life imprisonment </s>
<s> the law therefore allows the offence to be treated just as seriously as rape and we have seen how some would argue that it should be included as a form of rape or at least as a form of the most serious offence of sexual assault in any reformed law </s>
<s> according to the law of attempts the least that a defendant must be proved to have done is something more than merely preparatory to sexual intercourse with intent to have unlawful sexual intercourse without the woman s consent </s>
<s> whether the prosecution can prove attempted rape rather than the lesser offence of indecent assault will often depend on proof of the defendant s intention to go beyond the indecent acts already committed </s>
<s> this suggests that there is a strong argument for having two grades of indecent assault in english law or for moving some of the more serious forms of the crime such as forced fellatio or cunnilingus into a broadened crime of rape or serious sexual assault </s>
<s> in court 1988 the house of lords upheld the conviction of a man who had spanked a young girl several times on the seat of her shorts </s>
<s> second where rightminded observers would agree that the conduct was indecent that would be an indecent assault </s>
<s> there is no parallel here with punishment for attempts and other inchoate offences because there is no proof that the defendant was aiming to do something harmful the harmfulness of the action is supposedly constituted by the indecent motive not by anything actually done or about to be done to the victim </s>
<s> there is no indecent assault where the other party consents to the conduct and the fault element for the crime includes knowledge or recklessness as to whether the other party is consenting </s>
<s> thus if a woman were to have sexual intercourse with a boy under 16 this would be the offence of indecent assault by the woman even if the boy consented to or instigated the act </s>
<s> this restriction on consent is designed for the protection of the young to which we will now turn </s>
<s> there is a defence for a young man under 24 who has not previously been charged with a similar offence and who believes that the girl is 16 years old </s>
<s> in practice the vast majority of reported offences of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl of 16 involve young men of a similar age or a few years older and the general trend is to administer a formal caution to such persons rather than to prosecute them </s>
<s> the law is framed widely in the expectation that it will be enforced selectively </s>
<s> thus in cases where a young girl or young boy of 15 leads an adult into sexual activity the youth can not be convicted as a party to either unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 or indecent assault as the case may be </s>
<s> however there seems little reason for limiting the offence to cases involving children under 14 when the general age of consent to sexual activity stands at 16 </s>
<s> indeed the primacy of this antiexploitation rationale over eugenic reasons makes it desirable to extend the offence to cover adopted children as well as bloodrelationships </s>
<s> surely the offence of incest should cover all cases of vaginal or anal penetration or penetration involving the penis </s>
<s> thus the crime of incest covers sexual relations by mature adults in situations where the rationale of punishing exploitation of the young should no longer apply </s>
<s> one question therefore is whether the age should be reduced to 16 which is the general age of consent for sexual activity </s>
<s> it is evident from this survey of english law on sexual assault that the parameters are open to considerable argument </s>
<s> so far as ranking the relative seriousness of sexual assaults is concerned however full account should be taken of the psychological effects of such offences </s>
<s> this chapter has dealt chiefly with the nonconsensual offences and this is important because it is the absence of consent which is the crucial factor in many cases of sexual assault </s>
<s> the clrc did give serious consideration to dividing indecent assault into two grades so the idea of grading is not entirely alien to england </s>
<s> but all those changes could be justified out of respect for the principle of freedom of choice in sexual matters particularly where the enquiry is so straightforward </s>
<s> for example is there any substance in the claim that young men of 16 and 17 are more vulnerable socially and psychologically than young women of a similar age </s>
<s> probation officers it is argued are concerned with establishing rules for probationers and not inflicting pain on them </s>
<s> discourses on punishment and dictionary definitions of the term clearly specify the central feature of punishment as being the infliction of pain rather than the loss of liberty per se hudson 1987 </s>
<s> in these sections punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain and the review of the project will seek to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding but also more effective than this traditional understanding of punishment </s>
<s> at a time when the home secretary is inviting the probation service to move centre stage in the criminal justice system nacro 1990 p 17 it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take issue with the white paper s notion of punishment </s>
<s> as davies 1981 has pointed out speech is the basic tool of the social worker </s>
<s> in describing its vision of effective supervision the white paper goes on to note </s>
<s> offenders take part in alcohol education programmes so that they can learn to drink sensibly </s>
<s> however it does provide a useful introduction to the origins of the alcohol education course reported here </s>
<s> in 1985 the management of somerset probation service was faced with the fact that nearly one in three of the offenders supervised in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol singer 1985 </s>
<s> this aim is underpinned by three interrelated objectives and it is not without significance how they complement and serve to implement the white paper s own trinity of aims of supervision that is protection of the public prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in the community p 35 para 73 </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> the initial onetoone meeting held with one of the two group leaders serves to clarify what participants can expect from the course and what is expected of them </s>
<s> probation orders which are combined with constructive disciplined and effective programmes of supervision are increasingly being used for offenders who stand to receive custodial sentences 1990b p 35 </s>
<s> in recent years the probation service has devoted increasing resources to supervising the more serious and persistent offenders </s>
<s> however the course is not punitive it is not concerned with the infliction of pain </s>
<s> this is plainly evident from the section of the contract signed by each participant where what is expected of them is spelt out </s>
<s> you must be on time lateness will count as an absence </s>
<s> during this session the importance of monitoring is also emphasized </s>
<s> the aim at the end of the session is to encourage participants to make rules for their future drinking which will lead to a lessening of identified problems p 4 </s>

<s> this suggests perhaps two possibilities </s>

<s> although differences are not significant the overall profile indicates that female gp referrals were more frequently married aged between 16 and 44 had children and lived in more stable housing </s>
<s> insofar as gps were using section referrals as a method of social control it was more frequently upon these women </s>
<s> the difficulty of research in this area has meant that with one notable exception barnes et al </s>
<s> 1990 very large scale studies have not been undertaken whether on the 1959 or 1983 acts </s>
<s> it is also relevant that these were referrals to one mental health centre although the lack of asws in district teams meant that these represented practically all the daytime referrals to asws </s>
<s> the excess of these women in gp referrals it might be argued represents the excess of women with children seen in general practice shepherd et al </s>
<s> the incidence of informal admission was also higher in gp referred women </s>
<s> we may legitimately ask why given gps professional concern with mental health this should be the case to a greater extent than with other frequently lay referrals </s>
<s> first asws took responsibility for decisions diverting individuals from compulsory admission </s>

<s> so here there are only more or less likely speculations </s>
<s> most of the popular books showing the mesozoic giants in their natural setting portray them wallowing about in swamps flanked by deep vegetation their bodies largely under water </s>

<s> the balance of evidence seems to be swinging away from the original idea of swampdwelling giant dinosaurs to fully terrestrial habits </s>
<s> in the last few years a powerful controversy has arisen over whether the dinosaurs as a whole were coldblooded like all living reptiles and there is no doubt that dinosaurs were reptiles or warmblooded resembling mammals in this respect </s>
<s> on the other hand it can be argued that the sauropods like brachiosaurus were so large and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow them to sustain more continuous activity than smaller living reptiles </s>
<s> it has also been argued that the small mouths of the giants simply could not have downed enough food to support a warmblooded metabolism particularly plant food that needs a lot of processing before it becomes available as energy </s>
<s> the armoured or plated dinosaurs include some species that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour to have been very active but this does not necessarily mean that they had to be coldblooded </s>
<s> the warmblooded supporters tend to ally themselves with the supporters of a theory about the relationships of the dinosaurs </s>

<s> brachiopods begin to seem rather more complex animals than their simple shape suggests </s>
<s> the wavy margin also prevents the entry of irritating particles of sand with which the animal can not cope </s>
<s> this is likely to have been the lower valve and fossils are sometimes found in life position which confirms this </s>
<s> some species had long spines anchors attached to the lower thicker valve </s>
<s> unlike the brachiopods many of the modes of life of living bivalve molluscs can be more or less directly matched in fossil examples </s>
<s> some of these lived in shallow water sites and were gregarious like mussels </s>
<s> there are a few bivalves which are found in rocks deposited in the same sort of black shale environment that was mentioned above in the discussion of graptolite life habits </s>

<s> a successful policy for tackling the roots of urban disorder was seen as one which sought to involve all the community in dealing with the problems of each area so that they could come to feel that they have a stake in its future scarman 1981 para 642 </s>

<s> but the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sidelines of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven by irrational uncivilized and criminal instincts </s>
<s> similarly the spread of violence in london to areas such as the broadwater farm estate in tottenham was seen as a break from previous experience which had centred on areas such as brixton </s>

<s> the dear report on handsworth captures this image and links it to the social condition of young blacks </s>
<s> the government s record on unemployment was a heavily politicized issue and just as in 1981 it vehemently denied any responsibility for the riots through its pursuit of freemarket policies </s>

<s> first it distanced the riots from the social economic political and other grievances which had been linked to them by locating the cause outside the social problems of innercity dwellers and in the simple greed of the drug barons to accumulate loot </s>
<s> the chief constable for the west midlands geoffrey dear took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken place with the support of local community leaders </s>
<s> lord scarman s inquiry was not on the same scale as the famous kerner report in 1968 on the us riots but since the publication of his report in november 1981 his views and prescriptions have played an important role in fashioning political debate about the riots </s>

<s> what is important to note here is that aside from lord scarman s condemnation of the criminal acts committed during the riots the report was a strong argument in favour of a historical and social explanation of the riots </s>

<s> while lord scarman was careful not to enter the political dispute between the government and the labour party on issues such as unemployment and housing his call for more direct action to deal with these problems along with racial disadvantage posed a challenge to the political legitimacy of the policies which the government had followed from 1979 onwards </s>

<s> any group of people will over time develop common rules governing their behaviour and these rules are often described as norms </s>
<s> examples of these unwritten rules are that parents should play with their children or that one should respond in the appropriate manner to a good morning greeting </s>
<s> norms are therefore ideal standards of behaviour </s>
<s> they are part of the culture of society and are passed on from one generation to the next </s>
<s> although many norms are shared by the majority in society there are also intragroup norms which govern the behaviour of particular groups of people but which may not be accepted by the majority </s>
<s> in a school teachers may share different norms to students and different groups of students and teachers may share different norms </s>
<s> they are perhaps the most obvious form of deviance in that crime is clearly behaviour which breaks the standards of society and which can result in some punishment </s>
<s> however and to complicate the issue it does not necessarily follow that all crime is always viewed as deviant </s>
<s> but there is a general agreement on the major works which form the bases of the different perspectives or theories as with other subjects sociology has its classics </s>
<s> in chapter 3 we will look at specific examples of criminal behaviour and will discuss and criticise some of the common assumptions about the nature and extent of crime in contemporary society </s>
<s> before we commence with these main themes some general comments on the sociology of crime as it is and has been studied might help students to appreciate the theories and research discussed in what follows </s>
<s> crime has persistently interested and worried people and attempts to make sense of crime and criminal behaviour have appeared in literary and intellectual writings throughout the ages </s>
<s> in a similar manner various other studies have indicated that a wide and diverse range of crime occurs at the workplace </s>
<s> bearing these problems and points in mind the participant observation method of research has been particularly effective in the study of crime </s>
<s> some of the problems inherent in the sociological study of crime are illustrated in the first reading in chapter 5 pages 76–77 </s>
<s> alternatively if you do steal from shops what would stop you doing so </s>
<s> between a small local shop where there is likely to be less security and a large supermarket or department store </s>
<s> better security and greater risk </s>
<s> or becoming convinced that such actions are wrong </s>
<s> would you steal from shops if it could be guaranteed that you would not get caught </s>
<s> yes answers to this question would suggest that formal social control mechanisms are the major influence with regard to shoplifting </s>
<s> although it might be very easy to steal from a friend or colleague and not get caught most people would feel this to be wrong yet such feelings may not exert such a strong influence over decisions as to whether to steal from a larger and less personal victim </s>
<s> while such notions may all contains some elements of truth they are by no means complete explanations of criminal behaviour </s>
<s> suppose for example that it could be proved that one cause of delinquency was lack of parental supervision </s>
<s> biological or physiological explanations are based on the notion that some individuals are predisposed to criminal behaviour because of their genetic makeup </s>
<s> in his book luomo delinquente lombroso developed a complex description of what he called the born criminal who could be recognised by a variety of physical characteristics in particular facial characteristics for example large jaws and ears and high cheek bones </s>
<s> to use his own language </s>
<s> this would necessarily ignore the fact that many criminals do not go to prison and that perhaps people in prison are not always criminal </s>
<s> however the fact that the study was restricted to institutionalised delinquents limits the validity of the association between body build and crime and delinquency </s>
<s> furthermore it has been found that the association between delinquency on the one hand and height weight and physique on the other is greatly reduced once social background factors are taken into account </s>
<s> while some genetic influence can not be ruled out just what is inherited remains very unclear </s>
<s> psychological theories however see these characteristics as a result of unusual or abnormal experiences rather than as inherited </s>
<s> however psychological causes are seen as treatable whereas biological causes mark the individual for life </s>
<s> the problem with assessing the influence of parental and family dimensions such as weak supervision or parental criminality is the fact that they are closely linked to various aspects of social and economic disadvantage such as poverty overcrowding and poor housing </s>
<s> to summarise these biological and psychological theories hold that the criminal is a particular type of person apart from the rest of society and with a special predisposition toward criminal behaviour </s>
<s> while there are no doubt predispositions toward criminal behaviour and clearly certain characteristics are inherited most sociologists would reject these individual pathology sort of theories </s>
<s> while some offenders suffer from mental disorders the vast majority do not </s>
<s> for numerous studies have shown that a high percentage of the population have committed criminal offences in particular high proportions of juveniles and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal </s>
<s> this is not because such explanations are wrong but because they are incomplete or inadequate </s>
<s> in our discussion of sociological explanations we will concentrate on the three major sociological perspectives and how they analyse and interpret crime functionalism interactionism and marxism </s>
<s> at the risk of oversimplification functionalist approaches were challenged by interactionist sociology in the 1960s and 1970s which has itself been criticised by the revival of marxistbased theories </s>
<s> thus through opposition to criminal behaviour the social group or society is strengthened </s>
<s> it is this argument which leads durkheim to state that crime is essential to the continuation of society </s>
<s> if society is to exist as a unity there must be an agreement on shared values </s>
<s> for this agreement to exist people need to be able to react against those who depart from or break shared values </s>
<s> it is possible for us to image a society of saints in which no one committed what we see as crimes in which everyone behaved in an impeccable manner </s>
<s> although talking of the inevitability and necessity of crime durkheim did not mean to suggest the more crime the better </s>
<s> more recent functionalist work though has been concerned with the causes of criminal behaviour </s>
<s> merton starts from the basic functionalist position that social stability is based on a strong consensus of values which the majority of people come to share </s>
<s> in societies where there is a strong emphasis on certain goals but where the means for obtaining them are unavailable to most citizens the result is a situation of anomie a situation in other words where the rules and standards governing behaviour have lost their influence and force and are liable to be ignored and where shared norms or rules no longer determine and direct behaviour </s>
<s> in presentday western society we have cultural goals of material success plenty of money a big house flash cars pretty girlhandsome boy for example </s>
<s> merton put forward five possible ways of adapting to this gap </s>
<s> thirdly ritualism abandoning the goals but sticking rigidly to the legitimate means of achieving them </s>
<s> nonetheless the work of merton has certain strengths </s>
<s> we will now review some of the major developments from functionalist theory based on notions of culture and subculture </s>
<s> while some forms of delinquent behaviour are clearly centred on acquiring goods or money a large amount of delinquency is expressive in character </s>
<s> the claim that status frustration is the motivating factor also suffers from a middleclass bias in that it is assumed that delinquents cherish middleclass status goals such as educational success </s>
<s> the theories looked at thus far have moved away from the view of the criminal as clearly distinguishable from the noncriminal </s>
<s> interactionists would question that implication and argue that they are made up of a plurality of values and norms which may often conflict </s>
<s> various studies have demonstrated that very few people have not broken laws and many people do so frequently without ever having their crimes recorded </s>
<s> from this viewpoint the criminal is an individual who has been labelled so by society and this labelling does not apply to all individuals who break laws </s>
<s> social groups create deviance by making rules whose infraction constitutes deviance and by applying those rules to particular people and labelling them as outsiders </s>
<s> becker 1963 </s>
<s> social groups create deviance by making rules whose infraction constitutes deviance and by applying those rules to particular people and labelling them as outsiders </s>
<s> without going into his work in any detail cicourel found that white middleclass youths are less liable to be identified by police and probation officers as having committed or being likely to commit a crime </s>
<s> in the procedures of arresting and charging individuals and in their treatment in court there are clear differences across the middleworkingclass divide and these serve to reinforce the public s and the police s perception that certain groups are inclined to criminality </s>
<s> for example knowing someone has been convicted of theft might influence one s reactions and attitudes to that person </s>
<s> this leads to a process of amplification or snowballing individuals who are caught and labelled as criminal see themselves so and act accordingly thus the label becomes more widely applied and firmly fixed and the criminal becomes more attached to that label </s>
<s> there was thus a spiral of amplification </s>
<s> labelling theory implies that criminals are powerless passive victims who have had the misfortune to be labelled criminal and have not been able to do anything about it </s>
<s> linked with this point labelling theories tend to disregard the origins of criminal behaviour </s>
<s> logically the social reaction could be expected to grow as would the individual s criminality with all lawbreakers becoming extreme and committed criminals </s>
<s> a marxist analysis of crime is not easily explainable and has to be understood in relation to wider aspects of marxist theory </s>
<s> as jock young suggests it is not the criminal nor even the administration of crime but in the final analysis the system itself that must be investigated </s>
<s> criminal law is assumed to express and reflect the interests of the ruling class </s>
<s> as evidence for this marxists point out that much of the criminal law is about the protection of property </s>
<s> this extension of the law has created new criminals who do not fit the picture of the typical criminal the young workingclass male </s>
<s> various marxistbased studies have aimed to demonstrate how the law reflects economic interests viewing the legal system as an instrument that supports the interests of the dominant class against threatening or disruptive behaviour </s>
<s> very briefly the basic marxist argument is that the selective enforcement of the law by largely ignoring whitecollarbusiness crime gives the impression that criminals are mainly from the working classes which serves to direct attention away from rulingclass crime </s>
<s> for example if the predominance of economic interests and power over other areas of society is not accepted then the marxist theory of crime would not be accepted </s>
<s> a more basic and crucial point is that the logical conclusion of the marxist approach would be that the introduction of socialism will lead to a society without crime where collective interests and responsibilities are all important </s>
<s> it is doubtful that such activities can be interpreted as remnants from precommunist society soon to disappear as socialism or communism comes of age </s>
<s> secondly they show that crime is predominately a workingclass phenomenon </s>
<s> thirdly that it is a male phenomenon </s>
<s> so let us start with presentday society and compare it with the situation twenty years or so ago and then compare that generation with its predecessor </s>
<s> the teddy boys were arousing similar apocalyptic warnings of the end of british society </s>
<s> in the 1930s there was a similar bemoaning of the passing of parental authority and the absence of restraint </s>
<s> the targets of criticism have a common ring football rowdyism and the increasing crime and disorder </s>
<s> in the 1920s there were fierce street battles in north london between spurs and arsenal fans </s>
<s> the music halls professional football and the noisy presence of workingclass people at seaside resorts on bank holidays were all attacked </s>
<s> thousands of boys and young men pale narrowchested hunchedup miserable specimens smoking endless cigarettes numbers of them betting all of them learning to be hysterical as they groan and cheer in panic unison with their neighbours the worst sound of all being the hysterical scream of laughter that greets any little trip or fall of a player </s>
<s> one wonders whether this can be the same nation which had gained for itself the reputation of being a stolid pipesucking manhood unmoved by panic or excitement and reliable in the tightest of places </s>
<s> neither does victorian britain provide any comparative baseline of a tranquil lawabiding society </s>
<s> a victorian parallel with presentday mugging perhaps </s>
<s> certainly in the midnineteenth century it was widely felt that life in the previous century had been greatly superior and that the increase in juvenile crime was a blot on this age </s>
<s> however writing in 1751 henry fielding paints a very similar picture with his prediction of an imminent slide into anarchy when the streets of the cities will shortly be impassable without the utmost hazard </s>
<s> time and again a permissive present is contrasted with the not too distant past </s>
<s> if such accusations are accepted we would be forced to conclude that with each generation crime and disorder increase dramatically </s>
<s> this is not to deny of course that crime and violence in contemporary society is an important social reality </s>
<s> however the preoccupation with violence and lawlessness is part of a long and continuous tradition rather than a new and unique phenomenon </s>
<s> however teenagers do not go out saying to themselves that they are going to smash a couple of telephone boxes or fight another group of teenagers </s>
<s> they will not know what they are going to do and will probably end up doing nothing </s>
<s> certainly there is fighting and delinquency at seaside resorts and elsewhere but if teenagers were seeking real violence then the casualties would be enormous </s>
<s> what they want out of a gang fight is a nice big bruise that they can show around during the week </s>
<s> the issue we will examine is why delinquency is so attractive to some and unappealing to other youth </s>
<s> all of the youths studied were in their last year of school and all were going to leave at the minimum school leaving age corrigan 1979 </s>
<s> the leisure activities of these youths centred on the street the arena where most illegal activity takes place where most of the fighting and thieving occurs </s>
<s> they made little use of the youth clubs and other leisure facilities other than as places to meet their mates </s>
<s> of course they were doing something standing around on comers in groups for example but as far as the boys were concerned nothing memorable seems to happen to them on saturday night </s>
<s> and as we saw in our review of the history of delinquency this has been the case throughout this century </s>
<s> at international level such local support is subordinated to the national reputation and hooligan fans from different clubs will join forces </s>
<s> certainly the fans of the english national team have earned an unenviable reputation around the footballplaying world </s>
<s> while football hooliganism is not solely an english disease to be an english supporter at a match abroad clearly has a powerful image that attracts many young fans an image which sees local fans and passersby retreating in terror and which has it must be said little to do with the achievements of the english football team itself </s>
<s> however this sort of explanation does not seem to hold up in the face of evidence that football hooliganism is by no means a uniquely modern post1960 occurrence </s>
<s> this suggests that theories linking football hooliganism to changes in workingclass community life are based on a somewhat dubious history </s>
<s> workingclass community life is as strongly established in glasgow as anywhere and football violence has occurred there for over a century </s>
<s> this study centred on the group nature and aspects of football support and of delinquency at football matches </s>
<s> lastly were the town boys older boys and young men up to the age of 25 or so who had previously demonstrated their worth in the rowdies who rested on their reputations but would still participate in acts of violence if called upon </s>
<s> what the football terraces offer young workingclass males is a chance to escape the boring world of their everyday life </s>
<s> of course the fact that structure and rules are to be found within the behaviour of football hooligans does not mean that there are no problems at football terraces and that such behaviour is to be condoned </s>
<s> we are not trying to excuse the behaviour but to explain it </s>
<s> moreover even when it is detected it is often not formally and legally dealt with the middle class bias in criminal statistics will be discussed in more detail in chapter four </s>
<s> edwin sutherland s famous pioneering work in 1940 produced evidence that whitecollar crime might be substantially underestimated in official criminal statistics </s>
<s> we will also look briefly at the more trivial but widespread crimes of employee theft fiddling at work as an example of another aspect of workrelated crime </s>
<s> the fact that criminality is linked with respectability and power is central to marxistbased studies such as those of chambliss see chapter 2 </s>
<s> as well as being neglected in popular entertainment this type of crime has also been neglected as an area of study </s>
<s> it is not difficult to see why corporate crime has not received the same publicity as murder robbery theft rape and so on both in the mass media and in the study of crime </s>
<s> their misfortune is often put down to being no one s fault or an accident </s>
<s> that definition which is taken from box s study is rather longwinded but corporate crime is a complex issue </s>
<s> it is important to realise that the lawbreaking of large businesses and corporations can have severe consequences </s>
<s> early in 1979 fifty people lost their lives as a result of an explosion aboard the tanker betelgeuse whilst it was anchored at bantry bay in county cork </s>
<s> the economic costs are almost incomprehensibly large </s>
<s> there are also social costs which are again immeasurable </s>
<s> there are instances where individuals are caught between their conscience and the corporate policy and occasionally between their conscience and their jobs </s>
<s> in conventional crime one is charged with the results of one s actions </s>
<s> as box puts it a person accused of stabbing someone is not likely just to be charged with carrying an offensive weapon </s>
<s> this is not to say that businessmen should be responsible for all the indirect effects of their policies and actions or that for example the individuals in the company responsible for the hoist accident described above should be charged and sentenced for murder </s>
<s> the point is that as the laws do not focus on the results of corporate crime the corporate criminal need only worry about relatively lenient punishment for breaking a particular regulation and not be concerned with the wider consequences of that action </s>
<s> while the powerful seem to get away with serious crimes the powerless commit less serious offences and get prison </s>
<s> as well as crime for corporations and crimes against corporations employee theft there are corporations deliberately set up for the sole purpose of committing criminal activity </s>
<s> moreover fraud trials generally take longer than other criminal trials due to the sophisticated and complex nature of many frauds and they often stretch over many months </s>
<s> the first record of the term longfirm fraud which levi uncovers was in a journal of 1869 while the obtaining of goods under the false pretence that one had an honest and solvent business is an activity with a much longer history </s>
<s> longfirm frauds are to be found in most western countries and are liable to occur wherever there is extensive use of credit in business transactions </s>
<s> the success of the fraudster often hinges on the ability to tell a convincing story </s>
<s> however the more or less honest businessman who decides to commit a fraud just this once may become excited by the fun and challenge of it as well as by the material pro fits </s>
<s> fraud is one of the risks which result from the spread of credit </s>
<s> in this section we have concentrated on one type of whitecollar crime corporate crime </s>
<s> clearly the nature oft heft will vary with different types of employment </s>
<s> to gain an impression of the extent of employee theft we will look at a study of fiddling and pilferage at a mediumsized factoryproduction bakery in southeast england undertaken by jason ditton 1977 </s>
<s> as the night manager said you ve got to allow for losses you get the odd loaf taken home and not paid for </s>
<s> but always there is the implication that we all make a bit on the side know what i mean </s>
<s> rather than assuming that a few corrupt workers steal large amounts it would seem more reasonable to contend that many if not the majority of employees regularly take small amounts </s>
<s> this fiddling included overcharging increasing the price of bread to unknowing customers and keeping the price the same but reducing the size of the bread delivery </s>
<s> also the salesmen distinguished between those on their rounds who should not be fiddled such as disabled people exsalesmen and those who qualified as fair game </s>
<s> this distinction can be seen as allowing the salesmen to defend themselves through providing a justification for fiddling </s>
<s> generally most of the men did feel some guilt and disliked fiddling but said i do nt like it but i have to </s>
<s> only in the crime of shoplifting does the ratio of females convicted even approach that of males </s>
<s> until recently differences in the rate of crime between the sexes was generally explained as being due to biological or psychological differences </s>
<s> a series of studies usually by men have argued that the female biology determines their temperament or personality and makes women more passive and timid </s>
<s> there is little evidence to support such explanations which are insulting to women in that they are viewed as faulty biological mechanisms which spend some of their time malfunctioning </s>
<s> moreover these interpretations emphasise too heavily individual rather than social causes of crime and delinquency </s>
<s> the basic argument with which we are concerned here is that the low level of female crime is a result of the expectations and constraints that are placed on women by society </s>
<s> burglary for example is an untypical female crime as it requires the criminal to be out alone on the streets at night and to possess masculine skills such as the ability to force an entry </s>
<s> if this does occur there is a danger that womens movements will be blamed for the rise in the female crime rate and that this may be used to argue against further female emancipation </s>
<s> certainly there is evidence that the number of women convicted of assaults woundings and violent crime has risen over the last two decades </s>
<s> for example the sunday times has asserted that in recent years we ve experienced a new aggressive liberated criminality in women 30 march 1980 </s>
<s> if this image has changed because of the way the media has portrayed female crime and linked liberation with violent crime then women are liable to be treated more severely by the police and the courts </s>
<s> this will of course push up the female crime figures </s>
<s> the issue here is whether the statistics on female crime provide an accurate picture of the actual extent of such crime </s>
<s> females are less likely than males to be labelled as delinquent and to be processed accordingly </s>
<s> in other words the old view that women s crime is physically explainable would still appear to be influential despite the fact that there is no real evidence for such explanations </s>
<s> if a woman is tearful and apologetic and can claim some biological disturbance then she is not likely to be treated as severely as a man </s>
<s> however it has also been argued that women are discriminated against by the agents of the law just as they are in other areas of life </s>
<s> there is no clear evidence that women receive massively more favourable treatment from the police or the courts </s>
<s> women are far more restricted than men in their access to the reward structure of society and women are still largely restricted to the private family sphere </s>
<s> in this chapter we have looked at specific aspects and illustrations of crime and the study of it </s>
<s> in the next chapter we will examine in greater detail the statistics on crime </s>
<s> so far as the type of crime committed is concerned throughout this century the great bulk of crime has always involved stealing of one kind or another </s>
<s> in particular there has been a major and disproportionate increase in shoplifting 3 per cent of theft in 1945 compared with 14 per cent in 1978 and in thefts from and of motor vehicles </s>
<s> crimes of violence comprise less than 4 per cent of recorded crime and while crimes of violence have risen rapidly in numbers in the postwar period there have been changes in the pattern of such offences </s>
<s> we will look briefly at each of these elements in turn </s>
<s> it is popularly held that juvenile delinquency is on the increase </s>
<s> one arrest in four is of persons aged 10–16 years and half of all arrests are of persons under 21 years </s>
<s> what seems to have happened over the last twenty years or so is that a higher proportion of juveniles are being dealt with officially by the police rather than being dealt with unofficially or warned </s>
<s> criminal statistics in all countries have consistently shown that more males than females appear before the courts and are convicted for criminal activities </s>
<s> of all offenders found guilty in all courts both magistrate and crown courts females make up approximately 11 per cent of the total magistrate courts deal with relatively minor crimes and civil actions whereas the more serious indictable offences which can be tried by jury are dealt with by crown courts </s>
<s> figure 42 shows the changed malefemale ratio for the 14 to 17 age group </s>
<s> in chapter 3 we looked at explanations for the differences in male and female criminality </s>
<s> for example the functionalistbased theories see crime and delinquency as a response to frustrations arising from lower social position and status </s>
<s> this does not necessarily mean that workingclass boys commit more delinquencies but that they are more likely to fall foul of the legal system </s>
<s> the national survey referred to above for instance found that both the lowermiddle and uppermanual groups had the same rates of delinquency 12 per cent </s>
<s> having given a brief overview of the social incidence or the pattern of recorded crime we will turn now to some of the problems involved in the use of criminal statistics </s>
<s> as a general point statistics are social products in that they are produced for organisations and governments </s>
<s> but in fact there are two major and important deficiencies with them </s>
<s> the bulk of this nonrecording is due to crime not being reported to the police </s>
<s> it is the police who have to decide whether the unruly pickets or drug users they pick up are prosecuted and if the police took every offender to court the legal system would not be able to cope </s>
<s> in contrast petty theft has a very low rate of reporting to the police and a low detection rate </s>
<s> below we will suggest and discuss some of these reasons </s>
<s> this list is by no means exhaustive and is only intended to illustrate some of the most commonplace reasons for the nonreporting of crime </s>
<s> these victimless crimes often involve one party or individual providing a service which the other party wants </s>
<s> in the examples given above neither of the parties involved would inform the police consequently the true numbers of such crimes are never known to the police </s>
<s> fourthly victims may feel that there is no point in informing the police because there is no chance of getting retribution </s>
<s> fifthly victims or witnesses of crimes may dislike of not trust the police </s>
<s> crimes among criminals are not likely to be reported to the police for obvious reasons </s>
<s> in a similar vein victims or witnesses may sympathise with the offender or be unwilling to inform on a member of their family or a friend </s>
<s> firms may be unaware of theft by their employees and shops will not be aware of particular instances of shoplifting </s>
<s> thirdly an increased willingness on the part of the public to report offences will influence the statistics </s>
<s> it is likely that certain crimes have increased not because people have become more dishonest but because it has become easier to commit such crimes </s>
<s> a final possible reason which relates to police practice is that individual police officers may feel under pressure to make arrests in order to appear efficient and to get on </s>
<s> as a young policewoman interviewed as part of a recent study on merseyside s police said it s always at the back of your mind you just ca nt get rid of it </s>
<s> the police officer on patrol has to ask whether it is worth proceeding with and against every suspect and will often decide it is not worth it </s>
<s> of course this is not the same as saying that the rich and powerful never get prosecuted there are many specific cases which illustrate this point and which are generally well publicised </s>
<s> furthermore people are more likely to report suspicious circumstances surrounding an individual who appears to be of lowerclass origin </s>
<s> this is not practical or possible </s>
<s> there is also an element of bias when the individual comes into contact with the official whether police officer or magistrate which has similarities with the relationship between middleclass teachers and workingclass pupils </s>
<s> moreover while they do show that official statistics tend to underestimate the amount of crime it is likely that victim studies also underrecord the amount mostly because people can only report having been victims of crime if they know that they have been victimised </s>
<s> although such a statement is transparently obvious as we have demonstrated earlier there are a vast number of crimes where people do not know they are victims such as minor thefts and many whitecollar crimes </s>
<s> even with such conventional crimes however different people might interpret events differently and there might be a degree of underreporting because of this </s>
<s> some people may define a vague tampering with a door or window at night as an attempted burglary while others will not </s>
<s> for example studies have shown that 90 per cent of boys in the inner london area admit to having travelled on public transport without a ticket or to deliberately underpaying 82 per cent admit breaking windows of empty houses and only a small percentage claim to have committed no offences </s>
<s> alternatively respondents may exaggerate their delinquencies out of bravado especially likely with juveniles </s>
<s> the british crime survey of 1983 a research project carried out by the home office is a recent example of how victim and selfreport studies can be used to attempt to get round the problems of and deficiencies with the official criminal statistics </s>
<s> people were asked what crimes they had been victims of victim study and about their own lawbreaking selfreport study and they were also asked about their attitudes towards the police and policing </s>
<s> thus this survey combined the two methods we have been looking at above </s>
<s> although such figures might create public alarm the main reason given for nonreporting was because the offence was considered too trivial to waste police time 38 per cent of reasons given or that the police could do nothing about it 16 per cent </s>
<s> fear or dislike of the police was way down the list at 6 per cent </s>
<s> the survey shows that there were twice as many burglaries as were recorded by the police nearly five times as much wounding twelve times as much theft from the person and most unexpectedly perhaps thirteen times as much vandalism or criminal damage to personal and household property </s>
<s> whichever class of participants we choose to study and whose viewpoint we therefore choose to take we will probably be accused of bias </s>
<s> on the other hand if we view the phenomenon of addiction from the point of view of the enforcement officials they will tell us and we will be bound to report that they believe addicts are criminal types have disturbed personalities have no morals and can not be trusted </s>
<s> becker h s outsiders studies in the sociology of deviance 1963 pp 173–174 </s>
<s> not that it is impossible but practical considerations of gaining access to situations and the confidence of the people involved in any reasonable length of time mean that one will probably study the situation from one side or the other </s>
<s> it will be said that we are not doing justice to the viewpoint of the opposing group </s>
<s> in presenting the rationalisations and justifications a group offers for doing things as it does we will seem to be accepting its rationalisations and justifications and accusing other parties to the transaction in the words of their opponents </s>
<s> on the other hand if we view the phenomenon of addiction from the point of view of the enforcement officials they will tell us and we will be bound to report that they believe addicts are criminal types have disturbed personalities have no morals and can not be trusted </s>
<s> the idea for which it stands however is a commonplace of folk as well as scientific thinking </s>
<s> when we speak of a delinquent subculture we speak of a way of life that has somehow become traditional among certain groups in american society </s>
<s> the process of becoming a delinquent is the same as the process of becoming let us say a boy scout </s>
<s> when mrs jones says my johnny is really a good boy but got to running around with the wrong bunch and got into trouble she is making a set of assumptions which when spelled out more explicitly constitute the foundations of an important school of thought in the scientific study of juvenile delinquency </s>
<s> she is affirming that delinquency is neither an inborn disposition nor something the child has contrived by himself that children learn to become delinquents by becoming members of groups in which delinquent conduct is already established and the thing to do and that a child need not be different from other children that he need not have any twists or defects of personality or intelligence in order to become a delinquent </s>
<s> these groups are the boys gangs that flourish most conspicuously in the delinquent neighbourhoods of our large american cities </s>
<s> the process of becoming a delinquent is the same as the process of becoming let us say a boy scout </s>
<s> the difference lies only in the cultural pattern with which the children associates </s>
<s> nowadays we need the iron fist of policing in order that we might sleep soundly in our beds </s>
<s> indeed at the centre of the preoccupation with declining standards and mounting disorder there is an immense historical black hole </s>
<s> reading 4 </s>
<s> question weird idea </s>
<s> if we analyse the streetcomer activity of doing nothing in groups in the light of always hoping that something will happen then the creation and the putting into effect of ideas by the group can be seen as one of the most significant group experiences </s>
<s> their significance is not only in terms of the group experience but also in terms of the wider society for it is these ideas born out of the streetcorner groups doing nothing that are to a large extent the juvenile delinquency of the police and criminologists </s>
<s> question what other things do you do </s>
<s> their significance is not only in terms of the group experience but also in terms of the wider society for it is these ideas born out of the streetcorner groups doing nothing that are to a large extent the juvenile delinquency of the police and criminologists </s>
<s> a good idea must contain the seeds of continuing change from the boring situation as well as excitement and involvement </s>
<s> for the sort of interaction that we are referring to here is not the planned smashing of things </s>
<s> it is not that boys go out on a saturday night looking for milk bottles or other things to smash </s>
<s> rather they use smashing as something interesting to do </s>
<s> peter usually play football down the street play footy </s>
<s> peter on saturday i knock around with me mates </s>
<s> question what do you do </s>
<s> is it really necessary to explain the excitement of smashing things whether they are milk bottles shop windows buses telephone boxes or whatever if the alternative is to stand there and do nothing </s>

<s> strategies for integrating data reported at different geographical scales and for different map projections have received considerable attention over the past few decades robinson et al 1984 burrough 1986 </s>
<s> a fuller description of the process of data integration is presented by flowerdew and green in chapter 4 </s>
<s> there have been a number of published attempts to provide solutions to the crossarea aggregation or areal interpolation problem goodchild and lam 1980 lam 1983 </s>
<s> unfortunately the aggregations are generally chosen for nonstatistical reasons and so differ from data set to data set and are often unstable over time </s>
<s> for example the numerator might be a count of people in a postcode sector who have say a cancer yet because the census and health data are reported for different areal units it is not possible to find the appropriate atrisk population for the denominator and so compute a reliable incidence ratio </s>
<s> these are well known and have been described elsewhere lam 1983 wagner 1989 </s>
<s> in a truly integrated gis framework jackson and mason 1986 it is almost certain to be the case that other potentially useful information is available </s>
<s> in this chapter we develop a method similar to flowerdew s in which we use gis techniques to enable areal interpolation to be informed by the distribution of landcover types as inferred from a classified landsat thematic mapper tm image in both the source 1981 census wards and target national grid kilometre squares units </s>
<s> the basic idea is simple </s>
<s> provided the model relating population to these landcover data is reasonably good the resulting relationship can then be used to estimate populations for any set of imposed or natural areal units that can also be located on the image </s>
<s> previous attempts to estimate entire populations especially of third world cities include studies by ogrosky 1975 lo and welch 1977 and han 1985 </s>
<s> similarly a number of authors have used vertical aerial photography to estimate residential densities across individual cities see for example collins and elbeik 1971 hsu 1971 clayton and estes 1980 while others have experimented with the use of satellite imagery iisaka and hegedus 1982 </s>
<s> third there is the statistical modelling of the relationship between population and land cover and the validation of the resulting model </s>
<s> a landsat tm image of leicestershire recorded on a cloudfree day in july 1984 constitutes the basic data source </s>
<s> the ground resolution of a tm image is such that a pixel has about a 30 m side which seems appropriate for the scale of analysis used </s>
<s> the full seven bands of image data were loaded into an erdas earth resources data analysis system software system and ground control point information entered to rectify the image to national grid coordinates </s>
<s> information on agricultural land use is unimportant to this application whereas urban detail illustrating housing densities or alternative urban land is highly desirable </s>
<s> other similar attempts to produce urban cover classification using satellite data are discussed in jackson et al 1980 forster 1983 1985b wheeler 1985 lam et al 1987 and griffiths 1988 </s>
<s> in an interesting variation of the work described here quarmby et al 1988a outline the use of census data to derive training sets for classifying urban areas into housing types </s>

<s> 1 </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> in this study this was achieved by examining the estimated kilometre square populations together with those which were reported for the same areal units in the 1971 census of population </s>
<s> three methods were examined in detail using the minitab and glim packages </s>
<s> four wards are particularly badly fitted </s>
<s> the reduction to just the two landcover categories concerned with housing loses only 3 per cent explanation when compared with the shotgun model </s>
<s> the ordinary least squares model with forced zero intercept term is pop 81 541 houses or with poisson errors pop 81 540 houses this result implies that each pixel classified as having people living in it and there are 86 178 of these will on average contain 54 people </s>
<s> all three pick out the major features of the population density variation across northern leicestershire but of course as they stand they are impossible to validate in any direct way </s>
<s> first the 1981 census of population was not made available for grid squares and second our estimates were produced using a 1984 satellite image and 1981 census ward data </s>
<s> table 54 provides a summary of the overall fit in the form of the root mean squares rms of the differences for each map </s>
<s> the average ward population is 9488 table 51 and so the rms errors are comparatively small the range of rms errors is from 81513 for the shotgun ordinary least squares ols to 103529 for the simple poisson </s>
<s> figure 512 shows the differences given using the shotgun model which has the lowest rms value </s>
<s> the general tendency of this model to overestimate central city population and underestimate around the urban fringe is consistent with the known pattern of change </s>
<s> figure 513 shows the same data for the focused model which although it has much the same proportion of grid squares with differences in excess of 1000 people now gives a total range from 4799 to 8339 </s>
<s> if the general approach is fairly robust it ought to be that the relationship between population and land cover is fairly stable so that we would expect the model coefficients to be similar to those obtained from the ward data </s>
<s> it can be seen that in every case the two sets of coefficients have the same sign and general magnitude </s>
<s> however even allowing for the fact that the population and satellite data were collected 13 years apart the differences are greater than we would have liked </s>
<s> we are working on other methods of classifying images including textural classifiers in order to improve the statistical modelling </s>
<s> the problem arises because it is thought that the positional errors and attribute uncertainties which are characteristic of all spatial databases may be propagated and amplified by gis operations and thus adversely affect some or all applications </s>
<s> for thematic maps the principle cause of error is the original map document and its conversion to digital form </s>
<s> for remotely sensed data error depends on the accuracy of the sensing device and the pixel classification technology used in image processing </s>
<s> error and uncertainty have always been a feature of cartographic information </s>
<s> a gis gives the user complete freedom to combine overlay and analyse data from many different sources regardless of scale accuracy resolution and quality of the original map documents and without any regard for the accuracy characteristics of the data themselves </s>
<s> this is considered to be the minimum needed to allow a gis to function in a mixed data environment </s>
<s> error and uncertainty are common features of cartographic information so it is hardly surprising that these aspects are also present in digital versions of analogue maps </s>
<s> burrough 1986 identifies three main groups of factors that govern the errors which may be associated with spatial data processing </s>
<s> despite the availability of hardware for the automated conversion of geographic data from paper maps to digital form eg optical scanners much data input to gis is still done by hand using a digitizing table </s>
<s> as a result of human and other complicating factors involved a high level of error is often present in digital map data </s>
<s> sources of error in the digitizing process can be broken down into two main streams source map error and operational error </s>
<s> the accuracy of a digital representation of a line depends not only on the ability of the person using the digitizer to follow the centre of the line on the map exactly but also on the number of points they input to describe the shape of the line aldred 1972 </s>
<s> the number of sample points required accurately to copy a straight line is much less 2 than that required for a curve or complex line feature 2 </s>
<s> mcalpine and cook evaluated these results by classifying the derived polygons by size and boundary complexity </s>
<s> these common boundaries will have been digitized separated and so will not therefore coincide exactly </s>
<s> an attempt to estimate the cumulative effect of thematic map errors in digital overlay analysis has been made by newcomer and szajgin 1984 </s>
<s> this problem arises because each grid cell can only have a single attribute value and because the chosen grid dimensions are too large to resolve the spatial detail required </s>
<s> again this can be reduced by using a finer grid but problems with the increased amount of data storage required still occur </s>
<s> in conclusion to their paper walsh et al 1987 state that additional research in inherent and operational error assessment is warranted </s>

<s> as more components of the total error model become available as a result of research then they could be adopted </s>
<s> it does however present a number of operational difficulties that require basic research before it can be widely used </s>
<s> the procedure is to simulate the effects of input data uncertainty by a monte carlo approach that is often used in statistics to perform exact significance tests </s>
<s> the randomized input map data are then subject to an arbitrary sequence of gis operations </s>
<s> research is required to determine the appropriate value of m </s>

<s> integer and real data representations are mixed together in the logical records in the data </s>
<s> the headertrailer and topology information must also be preserved exactly and only the coordinate data perturbed </s>
<s> lastly the polygon data in the output coverage are rasterized and the rasterized coverage stored </s>
<s> there are several ways of achieving this </s>
<s> 4 </s>
<s> the site must be away from areas of population concentration </s>
<s> the underlying suitable geologies defined by the british geological survey chapman et al 1986 were digitized from 1 625 000 scale maps </s>

<s> the fuzzy tolerance of 25 mapunits was chosen to try to eliminate these from the final coverage </s>
<s> there are far fewer areas in the simulated map about which one would risk a definitive statement than in the map from the unsimulated process </s>
<s> a lightly loaded microvax 2 can expect to take over 24 h of elapsed time to carry out 100 simulations on a small problem </s>
<s> very few natural data come in grid form </s>
<s> one might buffer the ed centroids assign populations to the resulting zones then determine the population densities </s>
<s> the use of theissen polygons has been suggested although the statistical properties of processes giving rise to such areas are poor surrogates for digitized ed boundaries </s>
<s> it should be noted that all the experiments thus far have used vector representations </s>
<s> this chapter has introduced some of the issues surrounding the propagation of error in gis and described the preliminary application of a monte carlo approach to assessing their effects </s>
<s> there is likely to be substantial increases in cpu times although it might be possible to reduce this by a factor of 5 </s>
<s> geographical information systems gis make considerable demands on the user the wide variety of data types recorded in digital maps the complex data structures used to organize them and the range of operations available amount to a formidable obstacle for most users with standard requirements </s>
<s> as such the quality of interfaces to gis has taken on a considerable importance in terms of awareness training and usage both to the providers of gis software and users of gis alike rhind et al 1989 </s>
<s> however there are many aspects to the definition of an interface for systems as complex as gis and the solutions to this problem are developing extremely rapidly at the time of writing </s>

<s> it may also be true that ease of use can influence the quality of work done and the effectiveness of a gis as a decision support system </s>
<s> while there are many who would argue that a measure of technical knowledge is desirable in those who use a gis and a protection against the misuse of a powerful tool it must now be established that maximum achievable use of a software system owes much to the creation of a structured use environment with logic controls built into the interface </s>

<s> the result has been that in many gis spatial queries initiated by the user must be formulated in terms of a softwarespecific command language </s>
<s> however when he tested the system he found that the queries became far too long and complex to parse and execute for userinitiated queries </s>
<s> hence the link between the user interface and the spatial query processor is a problem of key importance and the subject of considerable debate </s>
<s> egenhofer 1989 in work on the testing of query processors suggests that it is not possible to hide the implementation structure of the query at the interface </s>

<s> a key consideration for the development of a spatial language interface to gls is that many different groups of users exist within the spatial datahandling community </s>
<s> it should therefore be emphasized that the first objective within the ugix project is to improve access to existing gls by converting the current functionorientation of the native system interface to a taskoriented interface usable by a spatially aware user see fig 72 for a taxonomy of interfaces for arcinfo at the time of writing in 1990 </s>
<s> appropriate information needed for a user to make a decision is also retrieved before presenting the command options for example maps with the correct specifications eg with topological relations already created when this is necessary for the operation </s>
<s> another key objective in developing a gis user interface is to improve the datahandling procedures to support the user s concept of maps as views of spatial data </s>
<s> hence the challenge for gis user interface design is to gain credibility for generic forms of interface it is this form of gis use that will ensure wider and more informed use of gis in the years ahead </s>
<s> questions on data availability are likely to be particularly important where users are heavily dependent on secondary sources </s>
<s> in situations of this kind provisions governing access and format may exert powerful constraints on the use that can be made of these data </s>
<s> the first four chapters in this part examine issues relating to geographic information handling in terms of four potential applications fields </s>
<s> authors were also asked to evaluate critically the state of geographic information provision in terms of the needs of users and to consider the impact of user requirements on the development of geographic information handling methodology </s>
<s> in this case however methodological issues are tackled from a largely user standpoint whereas in the previous part they were viewed as substantive problems in their own right </s>
<s> in effect the product of the discussion in both parts is a matrix where the methodological issues are listed along one axis and particular applications fields on the other </s>
<s> there are important differences between the chapters in this part both in the nature of the demands that they make on geographic information and also in the relative importance that is attached to geographic criteria as against other issues by planners and decisionmakers in these fields </s>
<s> a major feature of these applications is the extent to which they involve overlays of a variety of information drawn from different sources on a topographic map base </s>
<s> this contribution also indicates the wide variety of groups that are involved in monitoring environmental change and draws attention to the role that the european community is increasingly playing in coordinating these efforts </s>
<s> the discussion of operational problems and prospects further amplifies many of the issues raised in preceding chapters particularly with respect to the problems caused by the dependency on secondary data sources and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problems associated with linking data sets </s>
<s> the settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of users with a great diversity of interests </s>
<s> according to shepherd these users share a common need for uptodate information on the amount capacity and condition of urban land transport networks utilities hospitals schools and other major communal facilities </s>

<s> the evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlements and infrastructure fields </s>

<s> 1 </s>
<s> the bhopal accident killed 2000 and injured 200 000 more </s>
<s> as a consequence of these and other disasters of rapid and worldwide broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individuals the environment is now moving fast up the political agenda patten 1989 </s>
<s> in the past when we identified forms of pollution we have shown our capacity to act effectively </s>
<s> the great london smogs are now only a nightmare of the past </s>

<s> given such a lead it is scarcely surprising that british scientists have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequences of environmental events and processes table 91 for example illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the uk domestic economy </s>
<s> if it now seems selfevident that monitoring of the global environment is necessary indeed is even vital the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost as important the 170 000 people in the maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global sealevel change since no part of the islands is more than 2 m above present sealevel </s>
<s> even monitoring of the present is very imperfect as witness the order of magnitude variations in estimates now current for deforestation rates </s>
<s> even at this stage however it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many processes in the natural environment </s>
<s> the next section therefore attempts to summarize what we do know it is derived chiefly from the earth system sciences committee essc 1988 </s>
<s> in contrast soil creation cf soil degradation may require hundreds or thousands of years </s>
<s> since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge such as via tree rings palynology oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change </s>
<s> irrespective of the use of surrogates monitoring environmental processes only makes sense over timescales which are extended by human standards hence the igbp see below is designed to run for two or three decades </s>

<s> thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather 2 or 3 days ahead without using a mathematical model based on observations from all around the world </s>
<s> in ocean dynamics studies important topics are heat storage circulation and the role of sea ice </s>
<s> finally the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone </s>
<s> humaninduced changes to the environment have increased rapidly as a consequence of growing population numbers and of numerous developments in technology </s>
<s> it should be stressed however that while the outlines of human activities are clear there are still many uncertainties for instance we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen about 9 per cent since 1959 </s>
<s> an argument by many atmospheric physicists for example is that shortcomings in the accuracy of weather prediction over periods of more than a few days largely results from the unsophisticated nature of existing models the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power see fig 93 derived from tyler 1989 </s>
<s> as an example atmospheric temperature shows marked daytoday variability a strong seasonal cycle with some yeartoyear variations a weak minimum variability for 10–20 year averages and then increased variation again at longer timescales essc 1988 </s>

<s> it is convenient to point out at this stage that for colliding gravitational and electromagnetic waves two of the scalar polynomial invariants penrose and rindler 1986 are given by 82 it follows from this that in order to prove the existence of a scalar polynomial curvature singularity it is sufficient merely to show that the component 2 is unbounded </s>
<s> nor does it apply to the colliding electromagnetic wave solution of bell and szekeres 1974 in which impulsive gravitational waves are generated by the collision </s>

<s> a further class of exceptional vacuum solutions in which the curvature singularity is replaced by a cauchy horizon has been obtained by feinstein and ibañez 1989 </s>
<s> it can also be concluded that these killingcauchy horizons are unstable against small but generic perturbations of the initial data and that in a very precise sense generic initial data always produce allembracing spacelike curvature singularities </s>
<s> in addition to this there are apparent coordinate singularities extending from it into regions ii and iii </s>

<s> the problem arises from the attempt to represent spacetime on a twodimensional diagram </s>
<s> in many ways it would be preferable to attempt to picture a threedimensional structure as in figure 83 </s>
<s> region iv is curved so its representation should be considered no more than schematic </s>
<s> in the general problem however it is only the background region i that is taken to be flat and regions ii and iii as well as iv are curved </s>

<s> using 87 we obtain the equation 88 expressions for u and m in region ii can be obtained from 72 and 78 in the form 89 with these 88 may be integrated to give 810 </s>
<s> it is also appropriate to attempt to relate this general singularity structure to some initial hypersurface on which the initial cauchy data for the colliding wave problem is specified </s>
<s> the existence of the topological fold singularities in regions ii and iii implies bounds for the initial cauchy hypersurface in both of the directions from which the waves emerge </s>
<s> following this a substantial paper in which the subject is analysed in detail was produced by szekeres 1972 </s>

<s> in fact it is quite simple to use the method described in section 72 to extend any solution in region iv back into regions ii iii and i we obtain the corresponding solutions in regions ii and iii simply by replacing g by ½ and f by ½ alternately </s>
<s> another singularity occurs in cases in which a wave with an unbounded wave front moves in a region where the opposing wave is nonzero </s>
<s> these singularities however are distributionvalued and their physical significance requires further investigation </s>
<s> it has also been argued in the previous chapter that these singularities have similar properties to the fold singularities that occur for colliding impulsive waves as described in section 82 in terms of the behaviour of neighbouring geodesics </s>
<s> as suggested by szekeres 1972 it is therefore possible to use these as coordinates in region iv although care has to be taken at the boundaries and it is not possible to extend these coordinates into the prior regions ii and iii </s>
<s> szekeres 1972 has indicated how to integrate this equation using riemann s method and has given a general solution expressed as a line integral involving a legendre function of order ½ </s>

<s> this clearly uses 1025 which does not satisfy the boundary conditions 73 which require that f and g must be smooth functions </s>
<s> such a possibility can only arise if the impulsive components of the matter tensor occurring on the boundary of region iv have negative energy density </s>

<s> in region iv there is a scalar polynomial curvature singularity on the spacelike surface on which and </s>
<s> it necessarily contains impulsive wave components </s>
<s> this contains the term which as in 1033 is required to ensure that e m is continuous across the boundaries of region iv </s>
<s> if the leading terms in the power series for f and g take the form 1039 then the required boundary conditions are satisfied if </s>
<s> there are however exceptional cases which occur when and </s>

<s> 1050 </s>
<s> the plane a is the u v or plane as in previous figures </s>
<s> if such a continuation is possible this would indicate that the waves would continue through the horizon until they finally end in a curvature singularity at </s>
<s> this case together with the above transformation has also been described by yurtsever 1988 a </s>
<s> with these coordinates it can be seen that the schwarzschild mass parameter which is unity in the line elements 1051 and 1053 is here related to the amplitudes of the approaching waves by </s>
<s> this global structure of the solution has been determined by hayward 1989 a </s>
<s> in addition he has suggested some possible extensions for the nonunique region beyond the horizon including one that is time symmetric </s>
<s> at the conclusion of this section it may be noted that ferrari and ibañez 1988 have shown that the shearfree principal null congruences associated with this type d spacetime do not focus on the horizon </s>
<s> all of the solutions considered so far have involved only legendre functions of even order </s>

<s> for continuity it is also required that and so d 1 and d 2 are constrained to the range </s>
<s> it can be shown that they are algebraically general in the interaction region </s>
<s> these solutions were originally obtained indirectly by first considering the weyl solutions for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes </s>
<s> however they will be presented here in a more general way that is also more appropriate in considering colliding wave solutions </s>
<s> it is appropriate here to start with the main equation in the form 1062 using the variables t and z defined by 1060 and then transforming it by putting 1072 where the parameters v and η are not necessarily real </s>
<s> figure 104 in the interaction region iv for the yurtsever solutions the variables v and cosh η are imaginary in the initial region marked a that immediately follows the collision </s>
<s> the inverse functions of v that appear in 1074 must therefore be excluded for colliding plane wave solutions since they must be regular along these boundaries </s>
<s> however when looking for particular explicit solutions it is necessary to consider only a few terms </s>

<s> one particularly important technique that has been developed in recent years is the inverse scattering method of belinskii and zakharov 1978 1979 which had previously been developed as a soliton technique </s>

<s> the nonsingular case occurs when </s>
<s> it may be noted that in this limit the rotation of the kerr solution vanishes and the solution reduces to the same part of the schwarzschild spacetime as the degenerate ferrariibañez solution </s>

<s> as described in chapter 8 these point singularities ensure the existence of fold singularities on the surfaces and in regions ii and iii respectively </s>
<s> such techniques are available in the axisymmetric case and may soon be extended to the colliding wave situation </s>
<s> so far most of the explicit solutions that have been presented have involved impulsive wave components </s>

<s> naturally however ernst garcíadíaz and hauser preferred to use the socalled hauserernst homogeneous hilbert problem approach see also ernst 1988 </s>
<s> the problem that is under consideration is the collision of two plane waves in a flat background </s>
<s> this problem has been formulated in earlier chapters </s>
<s> it has been found convenient to divide spacetime into the four regions as illustrated in figure 31 </s>
<s> in practice however things are a little more complicated since it is normal to make use of the transformation 67 to put in these initial regions </s>
<s> in this case the approaching waves are each described by three functions either of u or of v satisfying a single equation which is either 622c or 622b </s>
<s> the difficulty arises because as described in previous chapters it is convenient to use f and g or transformations of them as coordinates in the interaction region </s>

<s> in this way it can be shown that for any arbitrary point within the interaction region the function v is given by 146 provided that r satisfies 144 and 145 and that </s>
<s> thus it does not really provide a viable method for generating analytic solutions for any given analytic description of the approaching waves </s>
<s> the method only applies to linear hyperbolic equations and if the polarization of the approaching waves is not aligned the field equations describing the resulting interaction are nonlinear </s>
<s> the method employed by hauser and ernst 1989 a is first to find a oneparameter family of basic solutions by means of a suitable separation of variables and then to express the final solution as a linear superposition of these basic solutions </s>
<s> in fact their approach is based on the solution 108 which may be reexpressed in the form 148 for suitable functions and which must depend on the initial data </s>
<s> the initial data have already been described in section 141 </s>
<s> however for the noncolinear case this is replaced by two nonlinear equations or by the complex ernst equation </s>
<s> the nonlinearity of this equation introduces considerable difficulty into any attempt at solving the general problem </s>
<s> in addition practical methods for solving the matrix homogeneous hilbert problem for particular noncolinear cases still need to be developed </s>
<s> clearly this is an area where considerable further work is required </s>
<s> the two electromagnetic field components in the initial regions i ii and iii are taken to be </s>
<s> the components of the weyl tensor are initially all zero </s>
<s> accordingly the line elements in the initial regions may be taken in the forms of 419 and 420 namely 153 the initialvalue problem is now well set and it remains to find the unique solution in the interaction region </s>
<s> as usual it may be noted that 622a can immediately be integrated to give 15 4 where f and g are arbitrary decreasing functions in the interaction region </s>

<s> with the above transformation each interval of the coordinate x of length 2 π c corresponds to a circular region in the x y plane with the origin removed and cut along the line </s>
<s> clarke and hayward 1989 have also shown that the bellszekeres solution is extendable to the future through the surface but the extension is not unique because of the presence of the singularities </s>
<s> throughout the interaction region subsequent to the collision they have obtained a complete set of bounded normal modes that are expressed in terms of spinweighted spherical harmonics </s>
<s> it is therefore not possible to consider the effects of these perturbations subsequent to the collision </s>
<s> two possible extensions have been given by clarke and hayward 1989 </s>
<s> one natural extension of region iv is simply the future extension of the region as described by the line element 1514 </s>

<s> in spite of all this the design process itself is often thought about and executed without any formal considerations about people </s>
<s> there are many tasks where the operator is assisted only by handtools and simple powered machines for example in craftwork and surgery </s>
<s> the demands on the operator stem from two kinds of task which are not compatible because they require very different levels of skill </s>
<s> the extreme case of man as a source of muscle power is dealt with in the previous book in this series the body at work </s>
<s> human beings are needed for those tasks for a variety of reasons from their highly dexterous manipulative potential through to their ability to accept informal instructions </s>
<s> there may be demands in the sense that there are always obstacles to be overcome but these stem from the nature and the variability of the situation he is in that is the materials he has to deal with or the environment he has to move through </s>
<s> other demands will arise if the information presented is inadequate in content eg poor lighting may make it difficult to detect some relevant cues or in structure eg because of poor coding and presentation of information on dials charts or screens </s>
<s> correspondingly there may be output demands created by control operations which result in things happening too quickly or unexpectedly </s>
<s> the technical specialist who represents the people point of view implicit in the approach just described is the ergonomist </s>
<s> this service may simply be as a source of information or the ergonomist can have more power in that the design decisions involving people have to be approved by him </s>
<s> it will be appreciated that for most kinds of work and most working organisations it is not feasible to employ specialist ergonomists </s>
<s> this is because as already mentioned ergonomics is about efficient use of people </s>
<s> there are sometimes larger issues of whether what the system does is acceptable or not for example in weapon systems and the ergonomist as a citizen will have his own opinion on these matters but the ergonomist as an ergonomist is confined to questions of efficiency </s>
<s> thus systems are hierarchical and at each level the unit is considered as a functional rather than a physical entity </s>
<s> the enormous flexibility of the systems approach has its penalties in potential confusion due to the highly variable relationship between functional and physical entities </s>
<s> sometimes this relationship is fairly close for example in the nervous system the endocrine system the digestive system and so on and sometimes it remains almost entirely unknown for example the perceptual system and the decisionmaking system </s>
<s> this heat has to be turned into mechanical energy currently always by a steam turbine and the mechanical energy in a rotating shaft is then translated by a generator into electricity </s>
<s> the losses in this transfer of energy from one form to another can be calculated and the flow through the various subsystems can be traced </s>
<s> as the system operates it has to be controlled </s>
<s> the control of the flow of energy is partly through automatic servomechanisms and partly through human operations </s>
<s> in these terms the human operator is a particular subsystem </s>
<s> this interface takes its physical form in the control room </s>
<s> there will be certain physical mechanisms such as telephones typewriters and computers but the flow of energy is trivial and the interest centres entirely on the flow of information </s>
<s> consider for example a travel office </s>
<s> in this kind of office the variety of requests for service is probably such that it would be necessary to provide a set of categories of the main kinds of activities or functions </s>
<s> the resulting knowledge is the content of ergonomics </s>
<s> fig 12 shows the outline of the systems design process in a way which emphasises the parallel roles of the engineer and the ergonomist concerned respectively with the design of the hardware and the personnel subsystems and their common design problems of allocation of function and interface design </s>
<s> the human factors specialist can rightly be accused of wanting to have a finger in every pie because as he sees it behavioural considerations do affect every design decision </s>
<s> what are the human requirements which the new product or process is intended to meet and how far are they not met by those already available </s>
<s> this would normally be regarded as a matter for economists and marketresearch specialists but behind the formidable array of evidence which they will generate are more fundamental questions of consumer preference customer requirements and so on which are matters of human needs and prejudices </s>
<s> if the evidence is favourable then the next step will be to set up a design team containing members covering the relevant range of expertise </s>
<s> how much design effort is needed in the different areas will not be clear at this stage but unless the system is very simple there are bound to be problems of overlap and of how far to arrange subteams by discipline by function or by problem singleton 1987 </s>
<s> difficulties will emerge later unless considerable thought is given at this stage to the appropriate range of skills required and the consequent problems of interdisciplinary communication </s>
<s> there will always be the need for some intercommunication and the appropriate interfaces should be provided </s>
<s> organisational rules of this kind can be very helpful in steering between the excessive information flow eg memoranda copied to many people and excessive unilateralism eg refusing further discussion after the issue of formal documents </s>
<s> when there are a number of individuals or groups from different disciplines and pursuing different objectives within some overall specification it is obviously crucial that all their activities should be in line with the common goal </s>
<s> the behavioural symptoms of inadequate organisation of design teams are summarised in table 11 </s>
<s> this is the concept of all systems as human beings with various kinds of engineering aids singleton 1967a </s>
<s> the essence of the systems approach is that personnel decisions should proceed in parallel with engineering decisions partly to economise on development time and partly to provide scope for tradeoffs </s>
<s> it used to be considered that simulator specifications could only be proposed when the online system design had been completed but there are considerable advantages in developing the simulator before the online system so that it becomes a dynamic mockup of the real situation </s>
<s> for example a motorpump system may well have its own controls there will be standard maintenance procedures and there will be an operationmaintenance manual </s>
<s> it is a matter of storage access to and presentation of information </s>
<s> the operators of plant are bound to discover by experience aspects of the design which could be improved </s>
<s> in all behavioural matters and indeed in many technical matters also it is important to avoid the impression that when operations in practice contain undesirable features not predicted by designers then the designers have made mistakes </s>
<s> to give one example of the size of the documentation problem it is not unusual for a large process plant to have two or three hundred volumes of instructions </s>
<s> these include the operating instructions the maintenance instructions the suppliers instruction manuals the safety regulations and instructions for particular emergencies </s>
<s> it is increasingly common for advertisements to emphasise features such as manmachine harmony or user friendliness </s>
<s> in these cases it is clear that the design developed by constant trial in practice </s>
<s> an extended booklet should have a very good index or other access system to the information </s>
<s> this is a very large issue mostly beyond the scope of this book except to note that ergonomics is an exemplar of a style of thinking which is based on characteristics of people </s>
<s> it is therefore appropriate to bear in mind the position and trends in human resources in the community of which the workers are members </s>
<s> for such macrosystems the principle that the designer produces what he thinks the users need is being replaced by the principle that the users themselves decide what they want and the professionals assist them in designing as specified by the users </s>
<s> this approach generates another duty for designers and ergonomists to present to the users an array of possible options which will aid their discussions and choices </s>

<s> in india the total population is currently about 665 million of which 244 million 37 are economically active </s>
<s> this also shows that the predominant way of earning a living in a developed country now is in the service industries </s>
<s> from the end of world war ii to the early 1970s there was virtually full employment in developed countries but in the last ten years the position has changed considerably as shown in fig 111 </s>
<s> it should be noted that the trend of an increase in unemployment from about 5 to about 10 over ten years is sufficiently general to indicate that it is not a function of the style of government </s>
<s> since the beginnings of technology now about 200 years ago in the case of the uk the labour market has been in a continuous state of flux </s>
<s> there are considerable differences between the problems of socalled developed and developing countries </s>
<s> 5 </s>
<s> this is illustrated in developed countries by the increase in unemployment which is fundamentally a failure to properly utilise the total human resource </s>
<s> the general concept of work is also shifting from manmachine interaction to manman interaction with machines as aids </s>
<s> the behavioural specialists are responsible for providing data and attitudes for the policymakers which should redress the balance </s>
<s> if ergonomics is regarded as the science of work then work must be defined as purposeful activity rather than merely as activity for economic gain </s>
<s> this is daunting but it is also challenging and stimulating </s>
<s> virtually all human societies have developed the principle that the pattern of personal activity should change with age </s>
<s> correspondingly it must be recognised that an individual has entered work with a particular educational standard </s>
<s> more generally the effectiveness of the production system depends on the way the social system is adjusted to the technical requirements emery and trist 1960 </s>
<s> it follows that one of the main tasks of management is to control the interaction with the environment </s>
<s> it has emerged in many countries that as the standard of living rises it is more and more difficult to run an autocratic production system using the indigenous labour force </s>
<s> paradoxically it has not developed a formalised set of principles or immutable knowledge which could for example be structured into an academic textbook about sociotechnical systems </s>
<s> the system itself can be described as a set of functions necessary for the overall purpose </s>
<s> the reason seems to be that men and machines are fundamentally complementary rather than comparable this point was originally made by jordan 1963 </s>
<s> nevertheless it is not common practice to consider the manmachine allocation of function as an isolated design decision </s>
<s> more usually the allocation emerges from a pattern of related decisions including what can be reliably and economically achieved by hardware and software what the allocated tasks look like as integrated jobs for the human operators the skills and traditions of the available workforce the importance of safety and reliability and so on table 17 </s>
<s> as potential functional weaknesses emerge during the design appraisal further consideration is given to what functions might be allocated to the man or machine to provide greater mutual support </s>
<s> thus allocation of function requires a continuous juggling of functional mechanistic and behavioural approaches </s>
<s> there are also unspecifiable but none the less potent political restrictions some from within the organisation some from outside it </s>
<s> 14 </s>
<s> high technology can also be used to provide the operator with flexibility in the allocation of functions he can make his own decision about when to control manually and when to leave it to the mechanisms </s>
<s> it emerges from the above discussion that manmachine allocation of function is at best an oversimplification and it may lead to the neglect of some key features of human performance </s>
<s> only the human operator can cope with the concept of purposes and goals and more particularly with their modification in the light of changing circumstances </s>
<s> for example a designer may build up a sequence of actions which an operator must follow in order to cause his product to function properly he has synthesised the task from a knowledge of how the machine or other product was designed to function </s>
<s> a task is usually considered to be an integrated subactivity with a particular purpose as distinct from a job which is a particular kind of work carried out by an individual in a system context </s>
<s> there is no such deductive way of getting at the skill description </s>
<s> there are two problems in analysing tasks one is to acquire the evidence on which to base the task description the other is to record what has been found out in a way such that other people notably the interface designers and the personnel specialists can use it effectively to assist in their work </s>
<s> the test of a task description is does it indicate a necessary function within the system performance </s>
<s> skills analysis is an attempt to get at what is going on in the operator s mind </s>
<s> for a repetitive task there may be comparatively little going on in the mind which emerges at the level of consciousness </s>
<s> a task analysis in the context of fitting the man to the job can be very different from one designed to assist in fitting the job to the man </s>
<s> it is of course desirable to check that nothing has been forgotten and to this end it is usual to ask an operator to go through the designed procedure while observing what he does and also observing that the system performs as expected </s>
<s> the operating instructionstask description can be modified if the analysis reveals any problems from the operator s point of view anything which the designer may have omitted or any difficulties the operator has in moving around manipulating controls or checking information presentations </s>
<s> for complex processes the procedures can include stages of diagnosis see below because the operator has to monitor and interpret what is happening in the plant </s>
<s> thus he must have extensive knowledge of the parameters and their relationship eg pressuretemperature curves together with the safety limits of each parameter </s>
<s> sometimes the safety limits are fixed sometimes they are conditional on the state of other variables or plant sometimes they are merely probabilistic </s>
<s> the simplest thing that can go wrong is the failure of one mechanism such as a pump valve or thermostat </s>
<s> if the hiatus is serious he may have to shut down all or part of the system or it may trip automatically and the operator s task is to observecontrol the shutdown to a quiescent state </s>
<s> however the difficult condition which requires the most consideration because it is not that unlikely is one in which the operator is faced with a situation where various things have gone wrong naturally or by inadvertent human interference in the plant or instrumentation </s>
<s> there are further complications in that because of the plant failures not all the standard range of remedial actions will be available </s>
<s> a complete task description is impossible and the appropriate preparation for the operator is not in direct training but rather in educationunderstanding of the system and the way it operates </s>
<s> in serious cases the aim is to shut down the system safely </s>
<s> for example the worker may pause at one point and scratch his nose this may indicate that a critical decision is being made or it may indicate simply that his nose was itching </s>
<s> the art of task analysis always is to select what does matter reject what does not matter and separate into categories or stages something which seems at first sight to have no internal boundaries </s>
<s> the most complex and most difficult to analyse are tasks requiring original thinking often with many apparently random alternations between deduction and induction this occurs in fault diagnosis tasks </s>
<s> 11 </s>
<s> it is assumed that whatever an operator is doing can be classified into one of five categories operation inspection transport delay and storage </s>
<s> for example storage for a hand implies some static work the operator is holding something or exerting a force of some kind although there is no resulting movement </s>
<s> the meaning of the symbols changes somewhat because the separation of events is much more detailed </s>
<s> to broaden the emphasis on a twohanded process chart it is possible to add another column labelled attention or sensory activity and to try to describe human activity in these areas at particular points in the sequence </s>
<s> this goes beyond direct observations and requires some inference or speculation on the part of the observer </s>
<s> these are similar to flow process charts except that no standard symbols are used the chart is simply a list of the actions the operator takes but there may well be additional columns referring to the events which occur and the consequent information which appears </s>
<s> an example is given in table 1 </s>
<s> 1 3 </s>
<s> it is possible to obtain a kind of flow chart automatically as it were by using successive photographs of operator positions on the same photographic plate </s>
<s> more usually this is done by attaching lights to the wrists or to other parts of the body if the light is flashing at a known frequency the relative time of particular positions as well as the sequence can be measured </s>
<s> flow charts are a useful record of a process but are not particularly suited as a basis for analysis which might lead to improved job design or training </s>
<s> blocks may represent physical entities topics concepts decisions actions or processes </s>
<s> homogeneity is also desirable in the meaning of lines and arrows </s>
<s> the advantage of these is that the length of the path can be used to indicate time taken </s>
<s> again there can be concentration on events or on operator decisions </s>
<s> it invariably turns out that an operator makes a series of decisions partly on the basis of what is currently displayed online information and partly on the basis of other material obtained from his knowledge of the system performance his briefing and his operating instructions offline information </s>
<s> the functions are arranged in a sequence such that an arrow to the right on any line indicates how and an arrow to the left indicates why </s>
<s> fig 124 shows an example </s>
<s> this is not a performance diagram but a potential performance diagram fig 125 </s>
<s> 19 and 120 </s>
<s> the supervisor may also monitor the same information or may have his own separate displays or both </s>
<s> in such a team operation there will normally be a clear standard mandatory difference of responsibility but in practice what they actually do can overlap and overlap differently for different teams </s>
<s> the approach might consist of any one or any combination of the following techniques </s>
<s> although it is usual to model responsibilities in terms of a hierarchical tree there are bound to be overlaps between what appear to be different levels of the hierarchy </s>
<s> these shared or duplicated responsibilities are unavoidable and often in fact are desirable because the process is one of mutual monitoring which usually improves reliability </s>
<s> occasionally overlap may have the opposite effect due to the falling between two stools phenomenon two operators at the same level or at different levels may each assume that the other has taken a particular action which they both know is required </s>
<s> this provides a very clear picture of the total activity although the order of doing things may not be obvious </s>
<s> protocol analysis </s>
<s> because so much of the activity is in searching for information and processing it leading to a decision the observed output is obviously a poor indicator of total activity and his verbal commentary is a much better guide to his task performance </s>
<s> the presentation of the result may use any of the charting methods described in this chapter or may take the form of a descriptive narrative </s>
<s> their behaviour and achievements are observed and discussed amongst themselves and with the analyst fig 129 </s>
<s> task analysis has not and can not be reduced to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course </s>
<s> those not involved find it difficult to gain very much from a presentation of a task description </s>
<s> where is the return </s>
<s> indeed it will be described almost entirely as a liability because the costs will be known </s>
<s> the result is excessive reliance on rumour and continuous speculation which is not only timeconsuming but is also highly deleterious in morale terms </s>
<s> this is particularly so in high technology eg design and construction of ships aircraft power stations and chemical plant where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive </s>
<s> some peaks of demand can be dealt with by using consultants but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with illdefined but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation </s>
<s> this not only provides flexibility in the use of manpower it also improves communication </s>
<s> for example difficulties of communications and in particular how to inculcate the feeling within each individual that he and his performance are important to the organisation </s>
<s> software might be restricted as in this book to computer programs but it is sometimes used as the generic term to include all sources of information </s>
<s> sometimes the term firmware is used </s>
<s> however whatever the terminology used there is a requirement for design effort </s>
<s> the quality of procedures would be much improved if designers followed some simple guidelines table 116 </s>
<s> all these things can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedures should a validated by users under the normal conditions of use </s>
<s> there are many situations when the order is of no great consequence for example a safety audit of a new machine and in this latter case some logical structure is needed </s>
<s> as mentioned above the logic of the design may not be the optimal basis if the way the operator thinks and acts is different </s>
<s> systematic use of a checklist often reveals faults in work design such as inadequate access visibility and labelling </s>
<s> the international ergonomics association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced in edholm 1967 </s>
<s> a routine is the most common form of instructional material </s>
<s> a second important difference is that if he misses his place in a routine he will be totally lost whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make whatever correction is necessary </s>
<s> with twodimensional representations such as maps it remains important to avoid too much homogeneity and provide substructure in the form of main roads and key buildings or other features such as rivers </s>
<s> manuals which may contain maps schematic diagrams and other materials warrant separate consideration </s>
<s> often the manual has to be provided hurriedly at the end of a project when the budget is running out and it is regarded as a tiresome chore still required after the essential design work has been completed </s>
<s> most computer operators do not know or wish to know about the mechanisms and in any case these are not accessible to vision and manipulation </s>
<s> if it is large the emphasis will be on the start up procedure </s>
<s> parts lists including description reference numbers and sometimes drawings are necessary if the user is expected to deal with his own replacements </s>
<s> the changes within an individual are even more inexorably continuous </s>
<s> again it is easy to develop the illusion that a worker is a constant factor in a changing situation particularly for a person in the middle period of working life </s>
<s> for these reasons industry is moving towards a concept of the ideal worker as a physically fit adaptable young person </s>
<s> even so it remains true that the performance of the individual is a function of the way he developed skills in his earlier more formative years and the way in which his capacities and skills are still changing in the work environment </s>
<s> his natural endowment consists of a particular range of capacities physical strength mobility vision hearing intellect and so forth </s>
<s> the balance and integration of capacities and skills is achieved by the third attribute of aspirations </s>

<s> education is the ultimate form of skill training where no attempt is made to specify the particular purposes for which the skills might be utilised </s>
<s> this limits the potential rigour of design because the anchor of skill training is the specification of the objectives </s>
<s> skill descriptions are generalisable in that human operators have characteristic abilities and limitations and therefore have tendencies to perform in the same way </s>
<s> it requires a broader approach than task analysis in that it often involves tracing the acquisition of the skill starting from the kind of persons who undertake training the selection criteria through the training procedures to the end product the training success criteria </s>

<s> there are differences in skills analysis procedure depending on the kind of skill </s>
<s> the variety of management tasks is often so great as to warrant a task analysis with separate skills analyses of particular tasks or groups of tasks </s>

<s> for example a process control plant which consists of dials charts and visual display units responding to activation of switches is much easier to simulate than say an opponent in a game of tennis </s>

<s> even if these descriptions are valid they still leave open a number of questions particularly why the same mechanisms do not operate with girls </s>
<s> we need now only take note of the most salient features </s>
<s> the most obvious one is that of sex differences </s>
<s> the predominance of males particularly in the physical sciences and engineering throughout the western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed to cognitive differences which are too small nor to institutional factors </s>
<s> in contrast only a minority of girls express an interest in science at any age but there is no obvious swing from science in the middle and late teens </s>
<s> analysis of these responses provides further information on sex differences and between those opting for different subjects </s>
<s> for example girls at the age of 12 and 14 years seem to take a more mature attitude to personal relationships seeing their complexity and reciprocal nature while boys are more exploitative </s>
<s> for example they take the view that criminals should be severely punished or that anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate </s>
<s> this model was originally postulated by erikson 1965 and then developed by marcia 1966 and 1976 </s>
<s> some problems about identity arise with the young child in the context of home and school and others occur in later life for example on retirement </s>
<s> in this article we are concerned with egoidentity achievement in respect to career </s>
<s> marcia has put more detail onto the erikson model and suggests that in going from the initial egodiffusion condition to that of having achieved egoidentity two processes are involved crisis and commitment </s>
<s> a further possibility is that the individual may at least for a time hold onto beliefs and values taken without question from others for example parents teachers peers </s>
<s> opting for science will permit and possibly reinforce emotional reticence </s>
<s> for a girl at the foreclosure stage the situation is very different </s>
<s> consequently very few girls at the foreclosure stage will enter science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a model to do so from their parents and their school </s>
<s> neither boys nor girls at the moratorium stage are likely to be attracted to the science that is usually presented in our schools </s>
<s> however only a minority of adolescents will have reached the egoidentity achievement stage at the age when most pupils have to make crucial decisions about subject choice at school </s>
<s> delaying subject choice britain is unusual in asking pupils to make crucial choices about subject options in the 13–16 age range </s>

<s> emphasizing the applications and relevance of science to obtain a major qualitative improvement to recruitment in science with more girls and with students possessing imaginative flexible minds it would be necessary to make science appealing to boys and girls at the moratorium stage </s>
<s> our knowledge about the girls concern with personal relationships suggests that the introduction of some elements of the social sciences into the case studies might prove attractive </s>
<s> clearly there would need to be some drastic pruning of content </s>
<s> perhaps science teachers should not attempt to cover their subjects so comprehensively </s>

<s> in effect ignoring the effects of gender in this way merely reinforces stereotyping because it does nothing to challenge the definition of certain aspects of the curriculum as masculine or feminine </s>
<s> one of the main gains from the gist project has been the clarification of what is meant by a girl friendly science that is a science which will appeal equally to the interests and concerns of girls as well as boys </s>
<s> the survey of children s attitudes helped here research such as ormerod s 1971 ormerod and duckworth 1975 had shown that girls were interested in the social implications of science but did not tell teachers what the desirable teaching approach might be in practice </s>
<s> this told us that any simplistic assumptions about featuring female domestic interests in science would probably meet with failure </s>
<s> it was helpful that these topics also interested boys </s>
<s> these examples indicate some of the features of girl friendly science it builds on girls interests not just boys it explicitly encourages girls to see themselves as potential scientists and it includes some of the social and human implications and applications of science </s>

<s> the gist interventions described above relate to three of these vista women albeit briefly and temporarily redressed the numerical balance by offering female role models of practising scientists vista and the curriculum development which followed involved a limited repackaging of science to remove its exclusively masculine appeal and the singlesex classes and classroom observation showed how science comes to be defined as masculine in the mixed school </s>
<s> the industrial and social impact of science on health on people on the environment a focus on the beauty and complexity of the natural world are notable omissions from the school science syllabus </s>
<s> there will continue to be problems if science teachers are personally doubtful about girls ability to do science well even if their doubts are not voiced and anecdotal evidence suggests they sometimes are girls are unlikely to respond unless teachers show they believe that girls have something to offer science as well as the reverse </s>
<s> a national survey of teachers attitudes to equal opportunities found that men were more likely to be opposed to promoting equal opportunities than women but that differences in subject taught were more important than the sex of the teacher in determining his or her attitude </s>
<s> on both counts of sex and subjects taught the gist teachers were the least promising group which could have been chosen to promote sex equality </s>
<s> this is likely to be an effect of the classroom observation work carried out with gist teachers for a full account see whyte 1984 </s>
<s> 1984 </s>
<s> whatever may be the attitude of any individual teacher if she does not receive adequate support from the school in implementing change she is likely to give up or decide that the innovation is not worth the extra time and energy required </s>

<s> true education is not for every man the scrap of paper he leaves school with </s>
<s> the differentiated status of the three curriculum traditions discerned and their link with the way finance and resources are allocated and pursued is confirmed by a number of studies already undertaken </s>
<s> as we have seen the legitimizing institutions together with established and indeed aspiring subject groups share the vested interest in the belief that a scholarly discipline is needed if a school subject is to be granted high status </s>
<s> science emerged later as a branch of education and its assimilation into the existing institutions and structures was not achieved without some noticeable exercises of accommodation </s>
<s> was slowly inducted into the ways of the scientist a particular type of scientist also the pure researcher </s>
<s> furthermore the models of subject teaching which dominated and in many ways still do experimental work were part of this process </s>
<s> this is indicated in layton s references to the views of science on the one hand in terms of the disinterested pursuit of truth and on the other particularly by those involved in the great exhibition as the producer for the industrial market place so that science was to be studied for the economic benefits it would yield </s>

<s> ibid pp 14–15 </s>
<s> specifically the following points can be made </s>
<s> 3 </s>
<s> employers tend to use a range of recruitment strategies employing a number of devices </s>
<s> given employers lack of knowledge about qualifications and the relatively arbitrary way in which they use them it is difficult to give credence to the widespread notion that they are dissatisfied with the educational levels of young workers </s>
<s> more generally it can be suggested that the social reforms which have been pursued through educational reform in the postwar period prior to collapse of the liberal consensus and its political constituency need to be approached through a direct assault upon the structural sources of inequality in demandside institutions </s>
<s> in trying to provide some answers to these questions i shall demonstrate the ways in which antiracist and antisexist policies frequently mirror each other in rhetoric and analysis </s>
<s> at the same time they contain both obvious and hidden differences which also need exploring </s>
<s> are they based on some notion of inherent differences </s>
<s> ancestral origins from different geographical regions however are still assumed to be important in understanding pupil needs </s>
<s> we conveniently forget that these divisions and the classification of people as races have been historically and politically created </s>
<s> if we are not very careful black and white children in schools are seen as in need of a different education simply because of the culture they are expected to belong to </s>
<s> how homogeneous is the culture of white children </s>
<s> gender has been used historically as a basis of the organization of educational provision whether in terms of separate schools or separate curricula david 1980 </s>
<s> cultural differences resulting from the division of labour into productive and domestic forms provided a commonsense justification for separate educational provision focusing for girls on child care and domestic science </s>
<s> during the 1970s and 1980s the problem became redefined </s>
<s> one justification therefore for using race and sex as significant divisions is that these designate important cultural differences as educationally relevant </s>
<s> the ilea documents 1983 1985 provide a clear example of this alternative approach </s>
<s> 1983 p 6 </s>
<s> there are certain routine practices customs and procedures in our society whose consequence is that black people have poorer jobs health housing education and life chances than do the white majority </s>
<s> greater value and status is more often given to traditional male pursuits and occupations than female ones </s>
<s> a whole range of examples of sexism within education are given including textbook biases differential teacher expectations concerning pupil abilities differential teacher behaviour with regard to discipline and attention sexual harassment assumptions concerning the leadership qualities of males and the monopolization of power by males </s>
<s> this list is mirrored very clearly in discussions concerning racism in schools where equivalent differential experiences can be found </s>
<s> it is rather like highlighting the lion s view of captivity it implies that this is demonstrably different from the tiger s view and this draws attention away from the significant fact of captivity </s>
<s> the presentation of educational data which forms the justification for most policies is documented in discrete and unrelated forms </s>
<s> in ilea 1983 for example social class sex and racial achievements in education are documented in separate sections </s>
<s> p 17 </s>
<s> this section has raised two questions concerning pupil categorizations implicit in certain policy developments </s>
<s> if this is so what are the implications of this for practice in schools </s>
<s> the second question concerns the extent to which it is possible and desirable to prevent an oversimplification of the divisions created and reinforced within education </s>
<s> the problem of underachievement illustrates this particularly well </s>
<s> as far as female students are concerned </s>
<s> the msc in both the yts and tvei programmes takes the view that the perpetuation of sex differentiated subject and skill areas is a major problem at least in those areas where there is a shortage of skilled male labour </s>
<s> feu 1985b p 16 </s>
<s> the passivity and conformity of girls their lack of assertiveness and ambition their refusal to study hard rational subjects are defined as the problem </s>
<s> teacher assumptions concerning the classroom problems exhibited by west indian students have been documented for the past 20 years brittain 1976 rampton 1981 </s>
<s> key statements in many lea policy documents show a concern for harmony and stability which is never the case in sex equality policies or statements on girls education </s>
<s> since the 1950s an association between low school attainment the problems of classroom discipline and delinquency has been accepted as a male white and predominantly working class phenomenon </s>
<s> interestingly the accepted explanations for the problems that female and black pupils pose for schools and the suggested remedies are remarkably similar </s>
<s> examples may focus on differences in the structure of their language or parental relationships or the lack of parental knowledge of child development </s>
<s> teachers are asked to develop an alternative female culture of achievement and independence which will compensate for the romanticism dependency and passivity found amongst women in society </s>
<s> there is little if any analysis of why particular attitudes and behaviours have developed of the ways in which cultures are related to and continuously reinforced by the wider structural position of particular groups the ways in which cultures can be a rational response to the social position of groups at a particular time </s>
<s> in the third explanatory framework teachers attitudes rather than their knowledge are described as crucial </s>
<s> that teachers had stereotyped or patronising attitudes towards west indian children which when combined with negative views of their academic ability and potential may prove a selffulfilling prophecy </s>
<s> stanworth documented very clearly the differentiated assumptions which teachers held about male and female pupils including </s>
<s> remedial policies again tend to focus upon the school upon unintentional and institutional discrimination within education </s>
<s> stemming from the differing interpretations of the educational problems posed by black and female pupils outlined in the previous section a range of alternative policies may be introduced into schools </s>
<s> the following table illustrates a range of initiatives which occur in schools </s>
<s> could they be introduced as token surface changes or do they necessitate a fundamental reorganization of the way the school operates </s>
<s> similarly a few leas stepped up pressure on schools to implement antisexist policies asking for school policies within a particular time limit eg brent ilea pressuring heads to implement change organizing inservice courses humberside brent replacing text books and appointing advisersinspectors </s>
<s> there are however quite important differences of emphasis </s>
<s> there appears to be far more concern in antiracist policies to alter the behaviour and attitudes of white personnel compared with the attention devoted to altering male behaviour in schools </s>
<s> weiner 1985 </s>
<s> also whilst women s studies particularly in higher education appears to have achieved a certain respectability and is flourishing black studies is on the decline and receives little public support from those concerned about racism </s>
<s> the second theme concerns the similarities and differences in these understandings when focused upon race and upon gender </s>
<s> thus at this level of problem analysis of political and administrative policy formation antisexist and antiracist initiatives appear to mirror each other </s>
<s> sex segregation in the labour market is remarkably resistant to change and most women are channelled into appropriate areas </s>
<s> the concentration of black workers within manual occupations is being consolidated rather than eroded newnham 1986 </s>
<s> the quite different nature of the female labour market means that it is easier to introduce measures in schools and colleges which will improve the initial occupational choices of some female students particularly middle class or academically able girls </s>
<s> attempts to improve occupational mobility for them may concentrate on a few professional openings where their colour is defined as an occupational advantage eg race relations advisers or on employers eg local authorities with positive action policies or selfemployment small businesses </s>
<s> policies which address such issues are an urgent necessity </s>
<s> for by 1841 he had worked out not only his theory of the origin of species natural selection but also it seems his theory of generation or reproduction including heredity variation and so on pangenesis </s>
<s> it can also free us from many mistaken myths about darwin himself </s>
<s> fortunately there is a single antidote effective against both these myths and that is to start all over again with the most decisive source of darwin s new identity on the voyage as a committed man of science his zealous discipleship of charles lyell s 1797–1875 views in geology including biogeography and ecology </s>
<s> having now studied all three volumes of the principles of geology 1830–3 he was applying lyell s entire system physical and organic worlds alike to south america and beyond that the whole earth </s>
<s> henceforth this system provided the framework for his preoccupation with the problems of the extinction and origin of species </s>
<s> like his friend and the undergraduate darwin s scientific hero the physicist john herschel 1792–1871 lyell followed earlier writers most notably the scottish philosopher thomas reid 1710–1796 who had drawn this moral from the superior evidential credentials of the newtonian gravitational force over the cartesian ethereal vortices any causes invoked in an explanatory theory should ideally be known to exist through direct observation independently of the facts they are supposed to explain </s>
<s> lyell s system was therefore to exemplify an epistemological analogy </s>
<s> so in this science the present is to the past as the terrestrial is to the celestial in newtonian physical astronomy </s>
<s> but in offering no positive alternative account he had left the means whereby new species originate quite mysterious if not miraculous </s>
<s> because they were descended from them many sometimes descending from a single ancestral species </s>
<s> they are and any theory of species origins must explain why </s>
<s> first from way back in his edinburgh days and his apprenticeship to robert grant in invertebrate zoology he had been much preoccupied with comprehensive generalizations about sexual and asexual modes of generation sloan personal communication </s>
<s> as for man he is a species produced like any other lawfully his mental faculties the causal consequences of his bodily organization and not miraculously superadded while science is a quest for lawful causes that are evidenced both directly and independently of the many diverse facts they can explain and indirectly and dependently by the very multitude and diversity of those facts </s>
<s> his species propagation theorizing itself was accordingly constructed from the very opening of notebook b as an argument that starts with the sexual generation of one individual organism from another and ends with the propagation of one species from another </s>
<s> conversely then a new variety can be formed if this conservative action of crossing is circumvented by reproductive isolation of a few individuals in new conditions whether that isolation arises with or without geographical segregation </s>
<s> so for darwin in the early summer of 1838 the races of domesticated species are providing positive analogies especially for the final species formation steps in his argument </s>
<s> now as darwin sees it at this time for a change to be an adaptation it must be more than merely hereditary and advantageous it must be necessary rather than accidental elicited that is by the very conditions that make it advantageous as albinism sometimes seems to be by cold </s>
<s> it compounds still further those two legacies so actively conjoined since the previous summer of 1837 the historical biogeographical including ecological concerns that he had inherited from lyell and the generational concerns deriving from his study with grant and subsequent reading in erasmus darwin </s>
<s> first his explanation of resemblances and differences among species contrasts directly with any developmental stage theorizing as found most famously in robert chambers herbert spencer or karl marx </s>
<s> a developmental stage theory refers similarities and differences to moreorlessequal advances made from the lowest point on a universal scale of advance </s>
<s> but his very assumption that many descendant species may diverge from a single common ancestry precludes his construing descendants as grownup ancestors and ancestors as descendants in embryo for any given immature embryonic life already has but one determinate mature adult future if a puppy as a dog if a tadpole as a frog </s>
<s> darwin as a genealogical biogeographer thinking horizontally as well as vertically to use ernst mayr s 1982 terms would explain change generationally but not developmentally </s>
<s> for it has led darwin to think of each species as spreading out into varying conditions over a range over time </s>
<s> and only the extension of a species not its intension as philosophers say only the collective membership of a species not the properties earning the members their membership in it can have a geographical range and a historical career </s>
<s> and then it is clear how darwin has come to be thinking of a species as a population of individuals with each member differing from every other because arising in a unique sequence of influences exerted by a unique succession of conditions and mates </s>
<s> for it sees him changing his mind about the adaptiveness of structural change rather than about species formation as such </s>
<s> for he moved at once to a postnatal ecological sorting wherein individual adaptive variants are retained while the maladaptive are eliminated in the malthusian crush of population </s>
<s> man naturally slothful according to malthus only spread into more adverse climes thanks to the local scarcities of food entailed by his excess fertility with later settlers always eventually victorious because made doubly energetic in struggling with both rigorous conditions and previous settlers </s>
<s> throughout 1838 darwin had been allowing for lyellian competitive defeats to extinguish some species before their predetermined ageing overcame them </s>
<s> with this new selective breeding analogy domestic races as adaptations are also providing analogies for the formation of wild species as ancient and perfectly adapted races </s>
<s> the third stage came seemingly early in 1839 when this new analogy prompted a further revision to the opening steps of the overall argumentation </s>
<s> if changes in conditions disrupt the precise replication of parental characters so as to yield hereditary variation then providing only that some of it happens to be adaptive this will suffice in the long run for selection as a cause of adaptive species formations </s>
<s> thus aphid parthenogenesis shows an unfertilized ovum producing a maturing organism with no prior interaction with a male element again socalled graft hybrids and the effects of pollen on nongerminal tissue in a female plant both show impressionability without fertilization and maturation while sporting and reversion in asexual plant buds show variation without fertilization or maturation </s>
<s> so pangenesis could have been derived from the 1838 position by pandynamic extension to the ova of powers previously denied to them and by a panovulational extension to all other parts of powers and matters formerly reserved for the ovary </s>
<s> but is that in fact how darwin arrived at pangenesis </s>
<s> however and whenever it was first formulated this pangenetic reduction of every mode of generation to microovulogemmation could take inheritance in so far as it was completely conservative to be effected by an exact replication of a whole in all its parts so that variation reversion and so on are explicable as disturbances suspensions and complications of that fundamental replicative tendency </s>
<s> thus could pangenesis unify all darwin s generation theorizing from gemmules to organisms and on to species and beyond them the whole tree of life </s>
<s> pangenesis was never however to meet the vera causa evidential ideal as darwin himself was keenly aware and he published it only after natural selection had been launched unencumbered by any such conjectural causation for generation </s>
<s> the argument of the 1842 sketch and so too of the origin was knowingly structured to accord with that vera causa ideal hodge 1977 </s>
<s> but then he had already had enough to keep him and many others occupied for a very long time </s>
<s> the social context </s>
<s> a capitalism connection is relevant in the 1840s and 1850s when darwin is applying division of labour theory to the problems of divergence schweber 1980 ospovat 1981 </s>
<s> here it is his family especially his grandfather and his mentor lyell that indicate connections with movements of thought directly linked with fundamental social change </s>
<s> in simple cases the consequences in certain conditions of newtonian gravitational attraction could be deduced and the adequacy of this cause for certain phenomena most notably elliptical planetary orbits thereby established </s>
<s> in its dependence on those presuppositions his biology was more like statistical than either celestial or quantum mechanics hull 1974 </s>
<s> the nontautologousness of natural selection </s>
<s> it is then a mistake to defend natural selection against the tautology objection by proposing criteria of fitness independent of reproductive success </s>
<s> wilson s position makes sense of a great deal in the history of general biological theory before and since 1900 </s>
<s> it has often been said that the decisive development since darwin was a new synthesis in the 1920s and 1930s of mendel on heredity and darwin on selection </s>
<s> darwin s integration of evolutionary and physiological biology had been attempted in the 1840s through pangenesis </s>
<s> physiologists were then increasingly agreeing that every cellular organism is either a single cell or a cell colony arising from the successive divisions of a single cell and that two cells come together to form one at fertilization each having arisen by the division of one cell in the respective parent body </s>
<s> in darwin s version pangenesis could not be squared with these cytological generalizations for if each of the two masses of gemmules coming together at fertilization is taken to be one cell then it has not arisen in the division of one cell in that parent while if each is taken to be a myriad of cells then far too many are coming together at fertilization </s>

<s> as stanley remarks laconically interspecific aggression is not characteristic of bivalve behaviour </s>
<s> if it does turn out to be of general significance at a variety of scales it will imply that the increased environmental stress associated in some way with regressions promotes an increase in extinction rate and corresponding vacation of ecological niches with a consequent opportunity for new species to establish themselves </s>

<s> in fact there are relatively few morphological physiological or behavioural characteristics that do not differ to some extent between males and females see glucksman 1974 and the extent of these differences varies widely between species </s>
<s> this bird born around 1762 lived in such comfortable circumstances that it had already reared eight broods when to the consternation of its noble owner it suddenly developed the plumage and spurs of a male and thereafter refused to lay another egg </s>

<s> 1979 1982 not only do stags that hold large harems hold them for longer within particular breeding seasons than those which hold smaller harems fig 23 1a but individuals that are consistently successful in securing large harems throughout their lives tend to live longer than their less successful competitors fig 231b </s>
<s> for example the fighting ability and reproductive success of red deer stags shows a pronounced peak between the ages of seven and ten years see fig 232 </s>
<s> this effect will also tend to overestimate variation in male success relative to variation in female success see fig 232 </s>
<s> especially in polygynous species males that fail to win a breeding territory spend their time on the fringes of the breeding population and often show high mortality </s>
<s> biased estimates of variation in reproductive success may also cause the effects of particular phenotypic traits on reproductive success to be overestimated </s>
<s> this applies particularly to traits such as body size which are themselves related to age </s>
<s> for example where the body size and reproductive success of males both increase with age the effects of size on breeding success may be grossly exaggerated if age differences in size are ignored </s>
<s> when the red deer samples are restricted to animals that reach breeding age sex differences in the extent to which breeding success varies are accentuated table 235 </s>
<s> considering that male red deer can hold harems of over thirty hinds it is perhaps surprising that male success does not vary more widely </s>
<s> this is partly because only a proportion of hinds conceive in a given year and individual stags rarely hold harems throughout the whole breeding season and partly because few stags breed successfully for more than four years </s>
<s> one surprising result of the comparison between red deer and kittiwakes is that variation in lifetime breeding success is little greater in red deer stags than in male kittiwakes see table 235 in fact if all individuals bornhatched are included it is slightly though not significantly greater in male kittiwakes </s>
<s> the comparison is an unsatisfactory one since there are important differences in the life histories of the two species male kittiwakes can breed for many more seasons adult mortality is not so strongly agedependent and females can fledge up to three young per year see coulson 1966 1968 coulson wooller 1976 wooller coulson 1977 </s>
<s> however this example serves to emphasize how misleading it can be to assume that the breeding sex ratio necessarily reflects the extent to which male reproductive success varies for even among closely related species it is likely to be the case that males have substantially longer breeding lifespans in monogamous species than in polygynous ones see wiley 1974 cluttonbrock et al </s>
<s> 1982 monogamous males might be expected to compete as intensely for the best mates or territories as do polygynous males for the biggest harems </s>
<s> more recently a variety of studies have demonstrated statistical relationships between the degree of polygyny and the development of sexual dimorphism though the relationship is not always a close one ralls 1977 </s>
<s> in the simplest of all possible worlds sexual dimorphism should perhaps be predicted by the relative slope of lifetime reproductive success on body size in males and females </s>

<s> few biologists have not at one time or another marvelled at the exquisite fit that can be found between the characteristics of an organism and the characteristics of its environment </s>
<s> darwin was not the first to marvel but he made the notion of such adaptedness scientifically respectable by providing an explanation of how it might have come about </s>
<s> however these assumptions are manifestly false when applied to behaviour particularly the behaviour of complex animals eg lorenz 1965 hinde 1968 </s>
<s> once a site in a bush or tree has been selected the pair of longta fled tits search for moss and bring it back to the site </s>
<s> the bird that is building can now place moss and webs around itself building up the sides of the nest </s>

<s> secondly the bird could copy what another more experienced bird had done the process of selecting the actions best adapted to the environment had gone on in previous generations and been transmitted socially </s>
<s> all three processes could contribute to the adaptedness of the nestbuilding </s>

<s> with precisely this point in mind konrad lorenz 1965 referred to the innate school marm who he imagined was busy directing the course of learning </s>
<s> it is worth noting that what lorenz meant by the memorable phrase was not that there were unlearned instructions for learning but the instructions were adapted for their present use by natural selection </s>
<s> it can be easily assumed that because we know how computers work we therefore know how learning is programmed </s>
<s> my distrust turns into hostility when phrases like genetically programmed are used instead </s>
<s> it may be complex but it is certainly not chaotic </s>
<s> something is responsible for the regularity </s>
<s> not everybody likes this style and among psychologists skinner 1959 in particular has derided the use of concepts based on inferred structures and processes </s>
<s> when that is done the thinking can be creative and rewarding </s>

<s> they do not avoid familiar food which has similarly been followed by illness and only certain cues such as smells and tastes associated with the novel food are attended to </s>

<s> it could be argued that in such instances an unlearnt program could still be detected at work behind the scenes since the general category of food and its effectiveness as a reward was in some sense built in </s>
<s> so the animal will work in order to provide itself with those conditions </s>
<s> also when considering development it must be stressed that we do not have to depend on an infinite regress </s>
<s> so in this case it looks as though the rules for forming some associations but not others are not dependent on learning for their development </s>
<s> the classic mistake has been to confuse experiences involved in learning with all other kinds of experience which the animal can have during its development see lehrman 1970 </s>
<s> change the social or physical conditions in which the animal is growing up and you may find it ends up with a different set of rules for learning </s>

<s> in other words the genetic relatedness of the partner is likely to be important </s>
<s> i have done this with japanese quail </s>
<s> of course remaining near a member of the opposite sex is not the same as mating with it </s>
<s> it would be quite wrong to suggest that the only influence on mate choice is relative familiarity </s>
<s> despite the variety and the complexity the animal work indicates first and foremost that mate choice can be profoundly influenced by early experience </s>
<s> filial imprinting is known to restrict preferences to the familiar see bateson 1979 and sexual imprinting could operate in exactly the same way </s>
<s> the net effect of superimposing habituation on imprinting would be to displace the preference away from the familiar </s>
<s> furthermore the best available mating may be with a sibling or an offspring on certain occasions </s>
<s> the conclusion is therefore that when an individual has no choice or an impoverished set of choices he or she may inbreed </s>
<s> finally the precocious sexual behaviour which is often observed between siblings and was the basis for freud s 1950 thinking about the development of sexual preferences may play a role </s>
<s> he based this conclusion on a very few individuals who married within their peer group in the kibbutz and were found to have entered the kibbutz during their childhood and usually after the age of six </s>
<s> this line of thought might also be applied rewardingly to explain one striking feature of divorce statistics </s>
<s> while a great deal is stili unknown about the development of sexual preferences in both animals and humans the similarities are quite striking </s>
<s> and how much of the variation in the prohibition is explained by the character of the inhibitions </s>

<s> we have attempted to align a previously independent field of inquiry cognitive and developmental psychology with evolutionary biology and particularly sociobiology and in so doing have constructed an ensemble of models that trace at times clumsily and imperfectly behavioural development from the genetic blueprint to the assembly of the nervous system to the learning process and then back down to the alteration of gene frequencies by natural selection operating within the context of particular cultures </s>
<s> the full sequence covered by our models is referred to as the circuit of geneculture coevolution </s>
<s> we know that human social behaviour is extremely variable </s>
<s> first human genes affect the way that the mind is formed which stimuli we perceive how information is processed the kinds of memories most easily stored and recalled the emotions they are most likely to evoke and so on </s>
<s> for example outbreeding is much more likely to occur than brothersister incest because of the apparently innate rule that individuals raised closely together during the first six years of life are inhibited from full sexual intercourse at maturity </s>
<s> individuals in the first natural group learned the words twice as quickly and retained them longer </s>
<s> some of the genes and chromosome aberrations affect behaviour in selective ways </s>
<s> recent advances include the calculation of the numbers of chromosomal loci and genes involved in such relatively complicated behaviours as dominance and drug aversive behaviour in mice and the epigenetic rules of colour preference in birds thompson thoday 1979 </s>
<s> an important principle of gene culture coevolutionary theory is that a tabula rasa mind open to all choices equally and hence totally dependent on the accidents of history must still have a biological foundation and a very finely adjusted one at that </s>
<s> such an effect which lumsden and i have called the pure cultural transmission of culture can not be achieved merely by removing genetic constraints on cognition and learning </s>
<s> all of the evidence from cognitive studies thus far indicates that human behaviour lies in between these two extremes that is in the category we have termed geneculture transmission of culture </s>
<s> moreover those who follow the rule benefit in natural selection </s>
<s> this is the size of many huntergatherer bands the social organization in which mankind has existed throughout most of its history </s>
<s> first it is technically possible to predict patterns of cultural diversity expressed as the ethnographic curves from a knowledge of individual cognitive development and also to perform the reverse to infer at least some of the principal properties of cognitive development from a knowledge of the pattern of cultural diversity </s>
<s> a recurrent working hypothesis of geneculture coevolutionary theory is that the epigenetic rules are shaped by natural selection over many generations </s>
<s> returning to the brothersister incest case for illustration we note that individuals who conform to the aversion leave more offspring </s>
<s> in the genetic models the tabula rasa brain in which the mind is created solely by the circumstances of history proves to be a very improbable outcome in the evolution of any conceivable intelligent species </s>
<s> and as the evolution proceeds small changes in the degree of bias can be expected to result commonly in much greater changes in the final cultural product </s>
<s> what is meant by science in this case is of course the physical sciences and to a lesser degree the biological sciences </s>
<s> but the solution is not as a few modern luddites have suggested the curtailment of science itself including sociobiology and the social sciences </s>
<s> quite the opposite the solution is to make every effort to extend new scientific procedures into the deeper reaches of human nature in order to provide solutions to those residual problems that continue to defy simple economic and technological solution </s>
<s> no natural boundary appears to exist between the natural and social sciences </s>

<s> if they can then the biological considerations are not going to show that they ought not to while if they can not so diverge then there is no question of ought </s>
<s> to say that human beings can not do certain things is of course an extremely vague form of statement </s>
<s> if some biological constraint can rule out or make unrealistic some normative practice or institution then knowledge of it may not only encourage us to decline that practice if it is suggested but may also contribute an explanation of why human communities do not in general display that practice or institution </s>
<s> might biological considerations then go further and explain the human adoption of other practices which are conformable to biological constraints </s>
<s> it is a problem which comes up at various points in considering the relations between biology and human practices and may be put in the following way how is a phenotypic character which would present itself in other species as a behavioural tendency represented in a species which has a culture language and conceptual thought </s>
<s> it may be said that in some cases at least such a tendency will show up in that species merely as itself that is to say as a merely biological character of that species </s>
<s> this is a matter that is worth some brief discussion since it is closely connected with the fuss that has been made about the application of the term altruism to animal as to human behaviour </s>

<s> between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased so that by 1988 there were 12 children s day centres about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted childminding places funded partially or totally by the social services department and 1075 fulltime and 824 parttime places in nursery schools funded by the inner london education authority </s>
<s> these social workers were based in the borough s special services team </s>

<s> day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children s day centres which would also provide information support and resources to parents </s>
<s> the specialist social worker and another underfives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children </s>

<s> it does nt matter that he s not like them </s>

<s> some children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups full or part time and made considerable strides in social relationships becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays whether or not they went to special school at 5 years </s>

<s> in some cases extra support has been unnecessary </s>
<s> the beacon nursery was taken over by the council as requested by mencap </s>
<s> the nursery was also influenced by the council s equal opportunities policies for example staff took part in a conference considering antiracist strategies with under fives </s>

<s> field day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure so that all day and residential services were managed through the neighbourhood office in which they were situated </s>
<s> underfives services were not identified as a priority </s>
<s> instead it proposed that the beacon and six other children s day centres be closed over the next two years with an increase in supported childminding placements to compensate in part for this loss </s>
<s> it is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the beacon resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise </s>

<s> in 1988 integrated placements are still being achieved against the tide </s>
<s> parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources in the interests of the child integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child s special needs </s>
<s> until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from nonspecialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements such placements will remain a rarity </s>

<s> it is a lengthy and wearing process </s>
<s> i believe that students with disabilities need to be valued as people and any establishment that implies this on paper needs to put policy into practice </s>
<s> senior management who truly support the right to continuing education for all learners are worth their weight in gold to lecturers who may be struggling to persuade colleagues in their own departmentschooldivision or otherwise that students with special needs are entitled to be included in the further education system </s>

<s> within a large establishment such as a college it is unlikely that they will avoid some namecalling or jokes at their expense </s>

<s> this necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise </s>
<s> history has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics that is to exclude the people along with their philosophy </s>
<s> the catholic church and the soviet state under stalin for example found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one </s>
<s> in our case the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion </s>

<s> we discussed with her 10yearold son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope </s>

<s> her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where i felt balbinder might not have seemed such a problem </s>
<s> in her opinion it was unlikely that he would get a place at cedars at such a late stage in the year </s>
<s> if balbinder was bussed to cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children s schooling and from an important part of her own role within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school </s>
<s> he explained that children came to cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed </s>
<s> cedars he told them was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training </s>
<s> another special feature was the size of the groups ten in the first year twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter </s>
<s> mrs singh seemed to be listening intently but i guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head </s>
<s> he illustrated different ways in which reading for example could be taught and how some children may not be mature enough to cope with a look and say approach or may not develop that way </s>
<s> the lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment </s>
<s> the workshop and home economics area were also impressive and the school had three computers </s>
<s> outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park </s>
<s> the school had an opendoor policy </s>
<s> he explained the procedure by which balbinder would be given a place </s>
<s> the head nodded reassuringly seeming to listen but he did not encourage her to talk about balbinder any more </s>
<s> mrs singh still pursuing her own thoughts said i wish he was just like other children like my other children </s>
<s> this had clearly been worrying them both </s>
<s> it was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences </s>
<s> it all seemed easy they sign on the dotted line and balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands </s>
<s> despite the school s stated intention to involve parents as far as possible i seriously doubted whether mr or mrs singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged </s>
<s> looking through the booklet the head had given them i guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it </s>
<s> i tried to explore the problems mrs singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many cedars parents </s>
<s> the educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of statementing which is complex </s>

<s> since they had evidently made up their minds none of this seemed important to them </s>
<s> i did not feel so optimistic </s>
<s> she told me that she had been present when balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist </s>
<s> balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles </s>
<s> she went on to her worries about jeetinder who still was nt bringing anything home from school </s>
<s> first the head went through the school report details of birth address etc </s>
<s> there were discrepancies in the report </s>
<s> the head stressed that what balbinder needed was to be in a small group not in a class of twentythree </s>
<s> in order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts </s>
<s> she found this very odd </s>
<s> the educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from cedars had visited balbinder in school and made very positive comments </s>
<s> it seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them </s>
<s> the head said he would chase up the documents </s>
<s> mrs singh and i talked mr singh through the meeting point by point </s>
<s> mrs singh balbinder and i set off to visit cedars school </s>
<s> his mother said he was not happy about the new school and wanted to stay where he was </s>
<s> he had after all had five terms there he would be 7 in december </s>
<s> the classes were small as was the number of ethnic minority children </s>
<s> there were one or possibly two afrocaribbean children overall and one or two asian children in each group </s>
<s> it was hot and the demonstration went on much too long but it gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do </s>
<s> the children were then asked to go out to play </s>
<s> it looked as if we would have to take him out but an older asian boy came and took him away and he went quite confidently </s>
<s> mrs singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school </s>
<s> balbinder ran outside straight away gesturing to me to come and look at it </s>
<s> in the car on the way home he sat alone opened the window and put his head out </s>
<s> decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him </s>
<s> however mrs singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw </s>
<s> i wondered whether she had any misgivings </s>
<s> my contact with the family became much less frequent </s>
<s> the coach which picked up the cedars children stopped about five minutes walk away from their home </s>
<s> my advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them </s>
<s> the section xi teacher who had particular responsibility for balbinder said that he was the least of her worries </s>
<s> he had been moved to a higher class seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him </s>
<s> looking back to her first encounter with balbinder a year ago when she had visited him at his previous school she said that she had been shocked </s>
<s> he had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on </s>
<s> in this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil </s>
<s> she reported on his good imagination something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail </s>
<s> the process of statementing has disrupted his normal development </s>
<s> it has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school </s>
<s> the analysis is based on observations of professional parent and professional child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the schools psychological service in three leas because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties </s>
<s> perhaps it is not surprising that without exception the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients </s>
<s> likewise they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decisionmaking </s>
<s> the former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations eg association of educational psychologists 1984 members handbook </s>
<s> the latter recommended by the warnock report des 1978 was established in law by the 1981 education act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the des 1983 1989 </s>
<s> many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying </s>
<s> mrs peel however saw things differently saying of the head she seemed to be assessing me rather than john it s like she s shifting the blame on to me she used to speak to me like i was a really bad mother </s>

<s> i felt because they could nt come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home it s all been dropped now i think </s>
<s> consequently cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them in the words of the community nurse to intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role </s>
<s> the exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation </s>
<s> likewise the ep after visiting the family on a number of occasions said that the community nurse s impressions do nt ring true with my own experience </s>
<s> however strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome </s>
<s> we show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of george s parents </s>
<s> george is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a workingclass part of town </s>
<s> the family have experienced a lot of conflict with george s school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts unsuccessfully to transfer their children to a different primary school </s>
<s> he disturbs their work </s>
<s> those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems george faced in the home </s>
<s> we can see here how at an early stage the discourse of needs was established </s>
<s> the main feature of this discourse was that george s needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers perceptions of their own needs in particular the threat george was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school </s>
<s> however despite the way teachers represented their views mr and mrs shod doubted the severity of the problem i do nt think he s any worse than other kids he s picked on by the school </s>
<s> it is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context </s>

<s> mrs short said she would prefer george to attend a mainstream school </s>
<s> mr short to be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he s a lot worse </s>
<s> mr and mrs short that s ok </s>
<s> it s going to make him worse </s>
<s> mrs short the way they were talking at that meeting george is going to residential school </s>
<s> after the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and tom resided for part of the week with each </s>
<s> mrs jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed </s>
<s> tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological service for assessment under the 1981 act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for tom s periods in mainstream school </s>
<s> the ep in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required </s>
<s> in any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an ewo we did nt ask for it the assessment it was the education system who said it should be done if i accept them into my home i do nt expect them to disappear for twelve months if they invited themselves in </s>
<s> whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing tom s unsettled home situation establishing an objective base line from which she and her exhusband could identify how their differences were affecting tom the ep refused to become involved in this area </s>
<s> it s difficult if i m to remain neutral </s>
<s> she had found this information to be very positive because they can focus on dealing with it now it spells out a lot of hope </s>
<s> mrs jones s response was no way am i going to agree with that </s>
<s> on the other hand on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests </s>
<s> but she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child s needs </s>
<s> the ep and lea were now presented with a fait accompli </s>
<s> chaudhury 1986 and rehal 1989 identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of leas and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors </s>
<s> goacher et al </s>
<s> on the other hand psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decisionmaking process </s>

<s> hegel articulates a philosophical structure of the appropriation of the other as a form of knowledge which uncannily simulates the project of nineteenthcentury imperialism the construction of knowledges which all operate through forms of expropriation and incorporation of the other mimics it a conceptual level the geographical and economic absorption of the noneuropean world by the west </s>
<s> it is thus entirely appropriate that hegelian marxism has become generally known as western marxism </s>
<s> anthropology has always provided the clearest symptomatic instance as was foreseen by rousseau from the outset </s>
<s> the reaction against this structure has produced forms of politics that do not fit into traditional political categories </s>
<s> here the problem rests on the fact that for orthodox marxism there can be only one other that of the working class into which all other oppressed groups socalled minorities must in the last instance be subsumed </s>

<s> their answer briefly was that reason had always contained a measure of irrationality which despite its best intentions had led to its involvement with tyranny and domination enlightenment is totalitarian </s>
<s> the very powers of rationality which enabled modern man to free himself from nature and control it had also become an instrumental device to dominate him </s>
<s> but it comprised rather a history of the west in which fascism was itself merely a symptom and included not only the history of european imperialism but also the defeats of the european colonial powers by japan in world war ii the subsequent french and american defeat in southeast asia the war in algeria as well as the many other colonial wars of national liberation </s>
<s> here we have a major difference from the historical pessimism of adorno s negative dialectics which in certain respects poststructuralism might appear to resemble </s>
<s> another such project was initiated by adorno s contemporary jeanpaul sartre whose attempt to define a new form of hegelian marxism via a reworked philosophy of consciousness in many ways more closely resembled that of the frankfurt school </s>
<s> foucault traces its history back to husserl s cartesian meditations 1929 and the crisis of the european sciences 1936 in which husserl posed the question of the relations between the western project of a universal deployment of reason and the positivity of the sciences and the radicality of philosophy </s>
<s> this enabled the establishment of a critical position in relation to science which for adorno remained so elusive </s>
<s> but what was it that brought about the return of the question of the enlightenment to contemporary philosophical enquiry </s>
<s> two centuries later the enlightenment returns but not at all as a way for the west to take cognizance of its present possibilities and of the liberties to which it can have access but as a way of interrogating it on its limits and on the powers which it has abused </s>
<s> reason as despotic enlightenment </s>
<s> 54 </s>
<s> foucault s account is particularly useful insofar as it gives a good indication of the characteristic french as opposed to german emphasis on the relation of marxism to enlightenment rationality and the questioning of enlightenment claims to the universality of its values </s>
<s> it is from this perspective that it becomes possible to understand the basis of the distrust of totalizing systems of knowledge which depend upon theory and concepts so characteristic of foucault or lyotard both of whom have been predominantly concerned with the attempt to isolate and foreground singularity as opposed to universality </s>
<s> so far as orientalism in particular and european knowledge of other societies in general have been concerned historicism meant that one human history uniting humanity either culminated in or was observed from the vantage point of europe or the west </s>
<s> what has never taken place is an epistemological critique at the most fundamental level of the connection between the development of a historicism which has expanded and developed enough to include antithetical attitudes such as ideologies of western imperialism and critiques of imperialism on the one hand and on the other the actual practice of imperialism by which the accumulation of territories and population the control of economies and the incorporation and homogenisation of histories are maintained </s>
<s> for said the problem amounts simply to historicism and the universalising and selfvalidating that has been endemic to it </s>

<s> everyone knows that that book is a critique of logocentrism what is less often recalled is that the terms of the critique with which it opens announce the design of focusing attention on logocentrism s ethnocentrism which derrida suggests is nothing but the most original and powerful ethnocentrism in the process of imposing itself upon the world </s>
<s> it is this preoccupation which accounts for derrida s choice and forceful interrogation of the privileged examples of saussure where he focuses on the profound ethnocentrism of his exclusion of writing rousseau and lévistrauss </s>
<s> the wellknown deconstruction carried out in structure sign and play shows how the constitution of anthropological knowledge though often paraded as scientific and objective is nevertheless governed by a problematic of which it remains unaware the philosophical category of the centre which derrida then proceeds to articulate with the problem of eurocentrism </s>

<s> this however is hardly the case for it rather involves if anything a more active critique of the eurocentric premises of western knowledge </s>

<s> we could say that if according to foucault the centrality of man dissolved at the end of the eighteenth century as the classical order gave way to history today at the end of the twentieth century as history gives way to the postmodern we are witnessing the dissolution of the west </s>
<s> this date and this gap are by no means fortuitous </s>
<s> by contrast it is certainly the case that with certain notable exceptions there are few marxist poststructuralists </s>
<s> in its preoccupation with textuality poststructuralism had apparently forgotten all about it </s>
<s> lentricchia s argument was quickly endorsed by terry eagleton who claimed first that poststructuralism represented a hedonist withdrawal from history aestheticism and a year later that it amounted to a more menacing holocaustlike liquidation of history </s>
<s> is anderson using the word random in its mathematical sense as one out of a series or in its statistical sense in which each item has an individual chance </s>
<s> it seems not </s>
<s> the terms of this argument repeat exactly those of the critical debate about univocal meaning according to which the only alternative to the idea that history has a single meaning must be that it has none at all </s>
<s> for history as althusser noted has always been a problematical concept </s>
<s> any examination of the history of history will demonstrate that it has never had the immediate certainty that is implied in the all too frequent invocation of concrete history </s>
<s> to acknowledge that amounts to something very different from simply excising history as such </s>
<s> the reproach that poststructuralism has neglected history really consists of the complaint that it has questioned history </s>
<s> criticizing the orthodox marxism which regarded dialectics as an external law validated by natural science lukács argued for the primacy of history over economics as the most significant element in the methodology of marxism </s>
<s> poststructuralism which in its own way also takes part in that history of western marxism differs only insofar as it foregrounds the implications of the theoretical difficulties involved rather than repressing them in pursuit of the unrealized ideal </s>
<s> in that work it is possible to see clearly the relation between his insistence on totality and the romantic aesthetic of totality as the inner necessity that moulds all works of art </s>
<s> more significantly totality is defined in terms of its absence for modern man who exists in a relation of alienation from the world </s>
<s> the history of western marxism amounts to a history of attempts to provide a means for transcending the condition of alienation and achieving that lost totality not through irony or a reified homogeneous temporality as in lukács novel but according to his formulation of marxism through history and class consciousness </s>
<s> the problem however is that that reconstituted totality is never certain its status always remains ambivalent </s>
<s> so in the historical novel 1937 lukács himself would reject as delusion what he calls a specially strong temptation to try and produce an extensively complete totality advocating instead a dramatic concentration and intensification of outwardly insignificant events </s>
<s> sartre founds communist action precisely by refusing any productivity to history and by making history insofar as it is intelligible the immediate result of our volitions </s>
<s> the second alternative poses a serious problem however insofar as it leads to the further question how could such marxism not be true in the sense of how could history in the objective processes on which a scientific marxism places so much faith be undialectical enough to produce stalinism from the october revolution </s>
<s> for merleauponty no sublation could resolve marxism s own division between its theory and the history of its practice itself he argued an acting out of its theoretical equivocation between history as a process of natural necessity and history as the product of human praxis </s>

<s> in a provocative comparison of the failures of the french and russian revolutions he argued that the problem stemmed from the fact that no class whether proletarian or bourgeoisie can become the ruling class without taking upon itself something of the historical role of a ruling class especially if at the same time it also considers that history carries within itself its own cure </s>
<s> 221 </s>
<s> or to put it another way he maintained that marxism can only constitute its totality through its perpetual detours from itself </s>
<s> and all the undertakings we might speak of reduce themselves to a single one that of making history </s>
<s> merleauponty had accused the existentialist sartre of denying history and trying to hold everything together instead only by the hopeless heroism of the i </s>
<s> everything therefore hinged on sartre s ability to substantiate the interdependence of these two claims </s>
<s> had he succeeded sartre would have established dialectical reason as successfully for the human sciences as kant had established analytical reason for natural science </s>
<s> sartre s claim for the continued validity of marxism as a method of understanding necessarily meant that he had to respond to the problem of stalinism </s>
<s> rather than reject marxism on the grounds that it had been disproved by history as merleauponty had done he sought to account for stalinism through a dialectical analysis of the specific history of the soviet union since the revolution theory and practice he argued had become separated with the result that the former had become sclerosed while the latter had become blind and unprincipled i 50 </s>
<s> if by 1945 merleauponty had here already indicated the historical basis for what was to become sartre s project in the critique the theoretical problem that followed was how to unite orthodox marxist concepts of economic determinism and historical necessity with the individualism of sartre s earlier work that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one s own freedom how to relocate human practice within historical determinism to reconcile the individual with the social the idea of agency with that of necessity or freedom with history </s>

<s> unlike lukács insignificant event from which the universal is precariously drawn out through the narrative sartre s singularity works synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal the relation between the two structured according to the familiar nineteenthcentury model of organic growth or process in which each singular event makes up the whole while as he puts it the whole is entirely present in the part as its present meaning and as its destiny </s>

<s> but its future direction remains unknown and indeterminate </s>
<s> at the same time sartre makes a larger though less persuasive claim that the boxingmatch also works synecdochally and reexteriorizes a more fundamental violence namely the interiorized condition of scarcity that he considers to be the basis of conflict in general </s>
<s> thus one can and must say that each fight is the singularisation of all the circumstances of the social whole in movement and that by this singularisation it incarnates the enveloping totalization which the historical process is </s>
<s> here certain similarities with later postmarxist theorists such as foucault or lyotard begin to become apparent </s>
<s> the effect of sartre s oscillation between these two poles is that his argument is increasingly drawn towards the very positions that ostensibly he wishes to refute </s>
<s> but sartre s own text here develops a dialogism in the tension between these two possibilities which becomes an increasingly dominant characteristic of his regressiveprogressive method and ends up by detotalizing the very totalization which he sought to prove </s>
<s> but it is rather sartre s own text that seems to be caught between these two dialectical possibilities of expansion and compression in a double logic </s>

<s> the indetermination he sought to excise returns to govern him </s>
<s> if political struggle takes place for specific purposes and anticipated results here sartre seems to condemn it to an unending series of detours that will never arrive at their destination </s>
<s> history therefore does have a structure of sorts a legacy of continual aberration </s>
<s> the problem however is that though sartre produces a provocative analysis of why stalin was successful this imperceptibly slides into an account of why stalin had to do what he did to the extent that sartre appears to justify his actions according to the particular necessities of his historical circumstances </s>
<s> thus sartre argues that it was necessary to choose between the breakup of the revolution and its deviation </s>
<s> stalinism in fact accords all too perfectly with the perverse structures of sartre s own theoretical argument </s>
<s> sartre takes the slogan socialism in one country as an example of the unintended but necessary product of the antilabour of the stalintrotsky conflict </s>

<s> madness and civilization was such a study but the assumption that it was possible simply to lift the repression and to let otherness speak for itself was questioned by derrida in his wellknown critique cogito and the history of madness </s>
<s> this led to two problems is there then any space from which a critique can be established and how does foucault reformulate the relation of writing to history </s>
<s> the history of madness would be the history of the other of that which for a given culture is at once interior and foreign therefore to be excluded so as to exorcise the interior danger but by being shut away in order to reduce its otherness whereas the history of the order imposed on things would be the history of the same of that which for a given culture is both dispersed and related therefore to be distinguished by kinds and to be collected together into identities </s>
<s> foucault thus modifies his argument that reason simply excluded madness and initiated the possibility of history by suggesting instead that the histories of the other and of the same are necessarily implicated within each other </s>
<s> initially foucault argues that the stasis of what he calls the classical order gave way to history which took over both as the form of knowledge and as the fundamental mode of being for empirical phenomena </s>
<s> the order of things by contrast points to the emergence of historicity as a mode of understanding and argues that history both as a form of knowledge and as the primary state of being of empirical phenomena broadly speaking the assumption of all marxisms is itself a historical phenomenon </s>
<s> this means that history can not provide an unquestionable ground for knowledge and that historicity can not claim an a priori privilege as the fundamental mode of being either </s>
<s> although this has been particularly influential for many forms of western marxism it also represents a deviation from marx s original claim that history is the effect of material conditions rather than of human consciousness </s>

<s> he explains this as follows </s>
<s> total or elsewhere global history assumes a spatiotemporal continuity between all phenomena and a certain homogeneity between them insofar as they all express the same form of historicity althusser s essential section whereas in general history the problem is precisely to determine the relation between different series whereas a total history draws everything together according to a single principle a general history analyses the space of dispersion and heterogeneous temporalities </s>
<s> instead of centring his analyses on the knowledge derived from the experience of the subject foucault investigates the conditions of emergence of the subject as the basis of knowledge he argues that at the same time as it was widely proposed as the one saving good of human civilization it also facilitated a more sinister operation </s>
<s> many of those now hostile to althusser continue to endorse this essay which offers a theory of institutional power dependent on the categories of the subject and ideology </s>
<s> foucault is critical of such a theory not just because it is based on a sciencenonscience distinction which for him is simply the product of a particular discursive formation which claims access to the real rather than involving any epistemological questions of truth or objectivity but also because it produces the notion of ideology as a secondary mediation as in althusser s interpellation in an insideoutside structure between the determinants of power and the individual subject </s>
<s> for foucault the tendency of theories of ideology to entrammel themselves in the categories of psychoanalysis even with the eternal in althusser s case means that they themselves begin to utilize the very procedures of individuation that they ought to have been analysing </s>
<s> foucault is particularly critical of the appropriating structure of totalization marxist or otherwise insofar as it implies the superiority of the theorist who produces the totalization of knowledge in the same way he distrusts the use of history as an encompassing framework because it works as a power structure that enables the expropriation and control of the past according to the perspective and truth of the present </s>
<s> it elides the fact that the historian will always also be historically located and therefore can not be in a position to produce a final totalization a dialectical situation anticipated by sartre </s>
<s> foucault argues that just as there can be no general theory of history but only particular answers to particular questions which make individual practices intelligible so the intellectual can best hope to be specific rather than universal universal in the sense of proposing transcendent values systems totalities narratives or teleologies </s>

<s> this argument which foucault derives from deleuze although at the same time he tellingly invokes sartre s theoretical formulation designed to solve exactly the same problem provides a way of avoiding the incommensurability of the relation of the event to the concept by allowing the disjunctive affirmation of both thus solving the problem that the concept as a part of the language of generality will inevitably travesty the event s singularity </s>

<s> it is thus a contradictory quasi concept a phantasm in which neither the elements of totalization nor difference can be definitively achieved or dispatched </s>
<s> but he made little effort to develop this outside his own definitions of the genealogical method while his shift into the problematics of power seemed to lead him into a labyrinth from which it was virtually impossible to extract himself </s>
<s> with respect to history the vacillations of foucault s writing enact the impossibility of its simultaneous finitude and infinitude the irresolvable conflict between history as meaning and history as difference between history as a teleology and eschatology and history as the event as finitude and mortality </s>
<s> in later work foucault veers away from his most radical philosophical insights towards an analysis of discursive and extradiscursive systems of domination and exploitation with increasing focus on the apparently more political question of power </s>
<s> whereas foucault was inclined to remark that in retrospect he considered that all his work had been about power it seems almost equally possible that his analyses of power constitute a continuing meditation on the phantasm </s>
<s> if this causes difficulties for some foucault s scepticism with regard to the tendency to inflate the effect of individual agency can only be compared to the position of many marxisms in which resistance and revolution are hardly the privilege of the individual as such but rather of collective class action </s>
<s> after all if the system really was bent upon the form of totalizing control that according to foucault psychoanalysis for example enables it is worth recalling that psychoanalysis has never been adopted by the state as such and that its activities remain confined to a few very limited districts in a handful of prosperous cities round the world </s>
<s> the claim for a straightforward oppositional kind of resistance also assumes that subjects can resist from a position outside the operations of power according to the dominant insideoutside model of conventional politics </s>
<s> this is the context in which to place foucault s own recognition after derrida s critique that he could no longer postulate madness or the other as outside after which he maintained that the other is also always inside he formulates the structures of power in exactly the same way so that the forces of domination and resistance are caught up sometimes indistinguishably within each other </s>
<s> acts of resistance may of course continue to be initiated through individual acts of will but as for sartre there is no guarantee that they will produce intended effects </s>

<s> the same was true in normandy where henry ii s concession to rouen between 1160 and 1170 soon to be a model for other cities across the angevin empire permitted internal selfgovernment by a mayor and town council but also allowed the duke to choose the mayor from a list of three names submitted to him by the council and protected the ducal right to military service </s>

<s> equally the improvements in fortification needed to withstand their effects thick stone walls inner as well as outer defences required incomes greater than those of simple lords </s>

<s> why then has the atomistic image been so powerful </s>

<s> to insist on denying the reality of such causes is to draw a bizarrely hard line between the physical and the mental aspects of a human being a line which does seem sometimes to be drawn in the social sciences and may prove handy in academic feuds between them and biology but which seems very badly suited to the realistic description of our lives </s>

<s> here it is important to know a whether male and female ideals diverge whether that is the moral outlook people have depends in some causally related way on whether they are male or female and b whether the ideals themselves are genderrelative that is to say whether what is good in a woman or right for a woman might not be bad in a man or wrong for a man and vice versa </s>

<s> but before turning to the central question of what ideals men and women should adopt it is worth speculating a little about what it is that causes these observable differences of moral outlook </s>

<s> rousseau 1762 trans p 333 </s>
<s> according to this conception a person is autonomous if he or she subscribes to principles that have been formed by his or her own moral scrutiny </s>
<s> i shall then show by reference to the work of kant and hegel how autonomy has been excluded from the private realm </s>
<s> even hegel who apparently extends the notion of autonomy to the private domain does not really do so </s>
<s> i believe that this view is too strong that although porn does reinforce certain attitudes towards women in the main it is rather a symptom and not a major part of the cause of power relations that exist outside the pages of penthouse playboy etc and outside the cinemas in soho or amsterdam see moye 1985 </s>
<s> up to the moment that the contract is made or more accurately is to take effect the agent retains both his status as a person and whatever rights this entails including the right to make a contract </s>
<s> p 283 </s>
<s> i agree with kuflik that it is not actually impossible to contract to give up one s autonomy but i do not think however that kant s argument can be so easily disposed of </s>
<s> since it may not be possible for both sets of belief to be realised in action if the courses of action are incompatible it may be rational for one person to give up hisher autonomy </s>
<s> as for the second type of case something that kant had to say may again be relevant </s>
<s> again it might be argued that there can be nothing wrong for a person voluntarily to allow themselves to be treated as a means to the satisfaction of someone else s desires </s>
<s> in other words wives in their marital relation to their husbands were quite specifically treated by kant as not autonomous </s>
<s> hegel is adamant than human beings can not be reduced to the status of things </s>
<s> he claims that rights arising from contract are never rights over a person but only rights over something external to the person for instance that person s body </s>
<s> in love men and women are living subjects who are alike in power and thus in one another s eyes para 62 </s>
<s> it is only the man who enters civil society the public sphere and in that world he represents the other family members </s>
<s> these powers will limit the extent to which men and women can be autonomous and equal in lovemaking </s>
<s> moreover hegel explicitly distinguishes the natures of the two sexes </s>
<s> man is a creature of reason woman is intuitive man is powerful and active woman passive and subjective para 166 </s>
<s> in losing themselves in their partners men and women are renouncing unequal qualities </s>
<s> rather than describing a relation between equals hegel s picture of lovemaking is very like his account of the relation between master and slave in the masterslave dialectic described in his phenomenology of spirit </s>
<s> indeed kant and hegel s accounts of the relation between man and wife in lovemaking are actually not far removed from a description of pornographic eroticism </s>
<s> in this passage hegel is asking the question how do i become aware of myself as a self </s>
<s> hegel however argues that we can not be fully aware of ourselves as selves unless we are conscious of other people </s>
<s> sometimes indeed we identify with another instead of seeing ourselves as independent autonomous subjects we identify with lady diana our headmistress or somebody at work </s>
<s> since we can not go on struggling with one another indefinitely hegel says that one must submit to the other </s>
<s> in fact the relation is disadvantageous both for the slave and for the master </s>
<s> ostensibly the relation between man and wife where they are linked by love and that between master and slave are very different </s>
<s> but the masterslave dialectic seems to capture the relation between people in pornographic eroticism </s>
<s> in the case of pornography what happens is that the one person becomes a body desired by the other but this is not reciprocated </s>
<s> she either involuntarily submits in this role as does the woman on the pages of penthouse or she does it voluntarily like de sade s justine or o in the pornographic novel by pauline reage the story of o </s>
<s> since the identity of the lover the woman becomes submerged in the other lover s desire for herhis body one of the two may become afraid and want to kill the other </s>
<s> throughout the film it has been the man the dominant male who got the woman to act out his wishes and fantasies </s>
<s> de sade said that if one wants to know about death one should look at sexual excitement </s>
<s> instead we have the masterslave relation one person partly being seen as the body desired by the other but where this is not reciprocated </s>
<s> things ought not to be this way in lovemaking however </s>
<s> people ought to treat one another as people as autonomous beings in lovemaking as elsewhere </s>
<s> often in pornographic eroticism there is no real lovemaking between people </s>
<s> one writer claims that the use to which the most heavily read porn penthouse playboy men only and mayfair is likely to be put is as material for masturbatory fantasies moye 1985 p 53 </s>
<s> in the theatre he argues there is a an internal dramatist who makes up the characters and their actions b an internal actor who represents to the reader for his benefit the actions he has made up as dramatist and finally c an internal audience </s>
<s> the first type of link between the fantasy representation and the world outside is that the fantasy materials the characters in the play and their actions are drawn from real life </s>
<s> but this is obviously not sufficient reason for us to condemn the porn </s>
<s> so what grounds are there for condemning the porn </s>
<s> in other words the representation of the desire as pleasurably satisfied reinforces the desire </s>
<s> thus pornographic representations are to be condemned because they reinforce the desires to treat people and it is usually women i n the way i have been arguing they are treated </s>
<s> even if the desire is never satisfied in any but the fantasy way the man who constantly has such desires is to be condemned for he is gaining satisfaction from a person whom he has divested of personhood and turned into a slave </s>
<s> if fantasy depictions of others are likely to have consequences for one s behaviour outside the fantasy then so are real ways of treating the other in lovemaking </s>
<s> before concluding i would like to raise a couple of objections to the view i am advocating </s>
<s> she appears somehow just as a woman whose main desire is to satisfy the wants of the one who gazes at her </s>
<s> but additionally pornographic magazines are bought and sold </s>
<s> so although there is an irrational element to eroticism it ought i am arguing not to be so irrational a process as to violate the other s autonomy </s>
<s> the man reading playboy will argue that he has a need for it </s>
<s> this suggests i think that i must refine my earlier criterion in the following way it is wrong for a person to be treated as a means to the satisfaction of another s desire and only allowable for them to be treated with their consent as a means to the satisfaction of another s needs if no other means for their satisfaction can be made available </s>
<s> indeed the former is a matter of life and death while the latter is not </s>
<s> in this paper i have argued that contrary to the thinking of some of the major representatives of the tradition which distinguishes the public world from the private one the notion of autonomy ought to be extended to the private sphere </s>
<s> children have served philosophy very well </s>
<s> they have received it in the shape of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to see them through the maturation process from infancy to adulthood </s>
<s> although it is fashionable to talk about its value for its own sake what prompts the theorising is the strong and wellfounded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turns out to be </s>
<s> the great philosophers have always produced such a personoriented account at least for those whose education was thought to matter </s>
<s> rationality turns into narrow intellectualism freedom into licence independence into isolationism dignity into selfish pride the autonomous human being turns out to be no more than a social atom after all </s>
<s> there are of course the familiar and obvious reasons connected with women s traditional role in childrearing but there are less obvious reasons too </s>
<s> a common result of this is that when the philosophers deny autonomy to women they do so for the same sorts of reason that they deny it to children and cite lack of rationality capriciousness and vulnerability among their characteristics </s>
<s> women philosophers are in a special position to consider such questions for in the image of the philosopher s child they see themselves </s>
<s> p73 </s>
<s> this principle is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties </s>
<s> i shall suggest that this does not follow because rationality is not in fact the grounds for the distinction in the first place </s>
<s> at what age ought the education for youth to begin </s>
<s> the traditional view is encapsulated in the claim that children are not autonomous that is on a standard interpretation they lack the capacity to act rationally in pursuit of their own selfchosen goals </s>
<s> there is obviously something wrong with a portrayal of children as totally lacking in reason until they leap out of bed on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on principle </s>
<s> hobbes does not tell us but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have </s>
<s> it is not language since hobbes is here talking about the prelinguistic child </s>
<s> but in the disclaimer his children need above all to be protected from the ghastly consequences of their own actions </s>
<s> the recognition that children can not simply be written off in the rationality stakes and can not therefore be denied autonomy on this account has led some writers to conclude that they can not therefore be denied it on any account </s>
<s> holt 1974 p 16 </s>
<s> like holt harris believes that the socalled incompetence of children is an adult invention imposed on children for adults convenience </s>
<s> harris 1982 p 49 </s>
<s> we must remember that to deny someone control of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult not to mention the injury which the frustration of their wishes and the setting at naught of their own plans for themselves will add </s>
<s> however much she may enjoy such pursuits there will be times when she would actually rather wander the streets unaccompanied </s>
<s> the point about an adult citizen is that he has these rights privileges duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them </s>
<s> rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems in the case of children </s>
<s> but the same can not be said for duties and responsibilities </s>
<s> duties and responsibilities are not merely available to a citizen they are an integral part of being a citizen </s>
<s> i do not say either that these rights and duties should be tied into one package that if a young person wants to assume any of them he must assume them all </s>
<s> holt 1974 p 16 </s>
<s> what he did not mean is that women lack rationality they can and do deliberate </s>
<s> his view is that the judgements which women make have no standing </s>
<s> 1 women lack authority therefore 2 women must lack some moral or cognitive capacity </s>
<s> the important point here is that aristotle s women are not autonomous not because they lack abilities or capacities but because they lack authority that is their right to make decisions to speak for themselves is not acknowledged </s>
<s> this acknowledgement is absolutely essential for without it no mental act which they perform however well will count as a decision at all </s>
<s> the point i am making here is based on an observation by stanley cavell 1979 p 460 and repeated by him in many contexts a human being could not fail to know confronting me that i am a human being </s>
<s> cavell s answer is that it is not </s>
<s> there is no way of seeing another human being except as another human being </s>
<s> treating people as if they were not people is not a possibility to try to do so requires all the resources of evil which the human mind can muster but it always breaks down </s>
<s> we can withhold acknowledgement from them on limited or selective fronts </s>
<s> this may not be downright evil but in the absence of potential disbarments like possibly being a rubber doll it requires a considerable amount of bad faith </s>
<s> rousseau s blueprint for the education of sophie is directed at this end and if it is truly successful she will internalise the lesson until neither her behaviour nor her demeanour will demand the acknowledgement </s>
<s> is this unfair to children </s>
<s> what we need to do is to show that withholding this acknowledgement is neither arbitrary nor unjust we have to ask does her being demand it </s>
<s> responsibility is an aspect of autonomy to which lipservice is commonly paid but which takes a back seat in most discussions about children </s>
<s> in his essay in defense of anarchism 1970 r p wolff does give responsibility a central place in his brief analysis of autonomy </s>
<s> he argues that freedom of choice makes a man responsible for his actions while the capacity to reason about those choices places him under a continuing obligation to take responsibility for those actions </s>
<s> ibid p 14 </s>
<s> ibid p 14 </s>
<s> what they do is to introduce a new element into the concept of responsibility which involves more than free will and reason now a third party is present and is an active participant in the language game in which responsibility has a role </s>
<s> this raises a difficulty </s>
<s> given the knowledge it is always possible to hold someone responsible for their actions </s>
<s> dickensian child victims grow into upright citizens if they grow up at all </s>
<s> if giving or withholding this responsibility were possible options in a oneperson game then this criterion would do nothing to counter the charge of arbitrariness but i have already argued that they are not and could not be </s>
<s> growing up maturing emerging into autonomy is the process of the child taking from the adult more and more of the responsibility for those actions which she does knowingly </s>
<s> respect for the dignity and freedom of the child consists in the recognition that the burden of responsibility shifts from the adult to the child as she herself demands it </s>
<s> this claim is not a conscious spoken claim if it gets to that stage we have already left it too late </s>
<s> the claim is implicit in the child s own social interactions and unless we are blind or acting in chronic bad faith we can do no other than acknowledge it </s>
<s> holding a child responsible is not the same as making her responsible we may succeed in the former without her cooperation we can never succeed in the latter </s>
<s> now it can still be objected that this is also true of adults and that i have still therefore failed to distinguish them from children </s>
<s> perhaps that yes her child is intelligent and thoughtful and even knowledgeable yes she would be as competent as many adults in coming to sensible conclusions </s>
<s> or perhaps she would just tell us that her child is not yet ready she would be right </s>
<s> and that really does belong to us </s>
<s> issues about women s autonomy have been central to feminist thinking and action </s>
<s> now ultimately i think that it is this definition of autonomy in terms of origin and the associated distinction between an inner self which can in some way spontaneously generate its own actions and external influences which are not part of the self that will need challenging </s>
<s> under this interpretation actions which originate from inside the self are those which are seen as in accordance with conscious desires or intentions and those which originate from outside the self are those which one would not do if one were not coerced </s>
<s> autonomy is defined as acting in accordance with desire or intention </s>
<s> but this brutality and coercion has been seen not merely as a question of physical or external coercion or constraint the force of subjection has also been seen as a psychic one invading women s very selves </s>
<s> the language of conditioning brainwashing indoctrination and so forth has been used to describe this force </s>
<s> the female self under male domination is riddled through and through with false or conditioned desires </s>
<s> i want now to look at some of these images of the female self in feminist discourse my particular examples are from the work of mary daly marilyn frye and kate millett </s>
<s> millett writes </s>
<s> when in any group of persons the ego is subjected to such invidious versions of itself through social beliefs ideology and tradition the effect is bound to be pernicious </s>
<s> mary daly s picture of the way in which women s selves are invaded by patriarchal conditioning is even more striking </s>
<s> in millett daly and frye women are seen primarily as victims the monolithic brutality and psychological pressures of male power have reduced women almost to the state of being nonpersons </s>
<s> and indeed as daly sees women as having become mutants or fembots so millett sees them as not having been allowed to participate in fully human activities which she characterises as those that are most remote from the biological contingencies of life and frye sees them as simply broken and then remade in the way that suits their masters </s>
<s> the spatial metaphor implicit in the word behind is not accidental since this model of self is premised on the possibility of making a distinction between an inner and an outer self </s>
<s> ibsen s peer gynt compared his quest for identity to the process of peeling layers off an onion but after shedding all the false selves he found that there was nothing inside no core </s>
<s> in gynlecology discovering or recovering one s own self is seen as akin to a process of salvation or religious rebirth and daly writes of what she calls the unveiling or unwinding of the shrouds of patriarchy to reveal the authentic female spiritself underneath </s>
<s> in the unitary and harmonious female spiritself there will be no such splits </s>
<s> freud ignored the more likely social hypothesis for feminine dissatisfaction preferring to ascribe it to a biologically based female nature </s>
<s> what we should be studying millett argues are the effects of malesupremacist culture on the female ego </s>
<s> the social factors of which millett writes are here seen as pressures which are external to the self and which have the effect of thwarting the conscious and unitary rationality of female individuality or the female ego </s>
<s> and the task is that of removing their influence </s>
<s> if in lady chatterley s lover the scales were to fall from connie s eyes and she were to see the worship of mellor s phallus for what it is a means of subordinating and oppressing women she could free herself and develop her authentic will ego and individuality </s>
<s> rather it is a situation in which choice and action do take place and in which the victim acts under her own perception and judgement </s>
<s> this will effect a displacement or dissolution of selfrespect and will undermine the victim s intolerance of coercion </s>
<s> she is healthy and working right when her substance is organised primarily on principles which align it to her interests and welfare </s>
<s> frye is writing here as if it were possible to distinguish the interests of one self sharply from those of another and as if were the effects of male domination to be undone it would not be too much of a problem for the self to know what its interests were </s>
<s> second that splits within the psyche should be seen as resulting from the interference of patriarchal or maledominated socialisation or conditioning </s>
<s> daly writes of unveiling or unwinding the shrouds of patriarchy </s>
<s> the precise nature and tone of this attitude may vary </s>
<s> mary daly s indictment of male power and brutality similarly allows little space for a consideration of the patterns of women s lives or the strengths and capacities that these might have enabled them to develop </s>
<s> if one is ambivalent conflicted uncertain confused unwilling to make wholesale rejections one stands to be accused whether by oneself or by others of bad faith of lack of courage of selling out of tokenism </s>
<s> i do not have space here to discuss the various ways in which versions of this conception of self have been influential in philosophy and psychology for instance </s>
<s> fantasy may be a threat it may be inexplicable bizarre and intrusive </s>
<s> yet the presentation of the book and lowry s text often speak of a fascination with the princess that is more than simply the fascination one can derive from the exercise of deconstructing an image </s>
<s> the text of fonda s book women coming of age 1984 exhorts women not to think thin and its theme is mainly that of health </s>
<s> but there are two other problems with this type of criticism which i want to focus on here </s>
<s> second it fails to recognise what is signally obvious in the experience of many women myself of course included namely that it is perfectly possible to agree in one s head that certain images of women might be reactionary or damaging or oppressive while remaining committed to them in emotion and desire </s>
<s> in his introductory lectures on psychoanalysis 1973 freud discussed the way in which symptoms are experienced in certain forms of obsessional neurosis </s>
<s> obsessional neurosis is shown in the patient s being occupied with thoughts in which he is in fact not interested in his being aware of impulses which appear very strange to him and his being led to actions the performance of which give him no enjoyment but which it is quite impossible for him to omit </s>
<s> obsessional neurosis is shown in the patient s being occupied with thoughts in which he is in fact not interested in his being aware of impulses which appear very strange to him and his being led to actions the performance of which give him no enjoyment but which it is quite impossible for him to omit </s>
<s> the thoughts obsessions may be senseless in themselves or merely a matter of indifference to the subject often they are completely silly and invariably they are the startingpoint of a strenuous mental activity which exhausts the patient and to which he only surrenders himself most unwillingly </s>
<s> p297 </s>
<s> one reason for this is that women and men of course are often faced with the problem of negotiating contradictory or conflicting conceptions of themselves </s>
<s> men may for example both see themselves as stronger than women and tend to see women as more weak and passive but also see women as having a power over them that can seem to engulf the man in forms of emotional dependence by which he may feel threatened </s>
<s> the concept of selfdeception is one that has constantly puzzled philosophers </s>
<s> but an important thing to recognise at the outset is that knowing about oneself can never be a matter of mere information </s>
<s> and sometimes it is i think not conscious at all </s>
<s> psychoanalysts have talked for example about the process of projection in which aspects of oneself of which one is fearful may be projected on to other people </s>
<s> i have outlined above some of the experiences and the problems about subjectivity that any adequate theory of self must be able to encompass in a way that the humanist paradigm is i think unable to do </s>
<s> there are approaches to understanding and theorising self which depart radically from the humanist paradigm </s>
<s> what they share despite their differences is an insistence that there is no original wholeness or unity in the self nor a real self which can be thought of as in some way underlying the self of everyday life </s>
<s> it is true i think that there is a certain sort of eclecticism practised for example by some neofreudian writers such as erich fromm or by the american ego psychologists which may undermine anything useful that freudian theory really has to offer </s>
<s> the french psychoanalyst jacques lacan argued that freud himself as well as virtually all the psychoanalysts who revised freud s theories never managed to escape fully from the assumption of an already existing gendered subjectivity which entered into the oedipal situation </s>
<s> feminism as i have said needs to preserve a critical distance from all theories of self </s>
<s> but it needs also to engage with those theories which deconstruct the distinction between the individual and the social which recognise the power of desire and fantasy and the problems of supposing any original unity in the self while at the same time preserving its concern with lived experience and the practical and material struggles of women to achieve more autonomy and control over their lives </s>
<s> but the danger in some deconstructionist theories however is that they seem to leave no space for the material struggles or ordinary aspirations of women </s>
<s> the problem then is not to be seen as one of whether we should continue to use concepts like identity or autonomy at all or simply reject them out of hand </s>

<s> by 1913–14 over £25000 was being given away in this manner and in return the central office agents were able to ensure the appointment of suitable constituency agents and the choice of good candidate the outlay constituted only about a tenth of the whole of the local parties expenditure but a much higher proportion of the expenditure of the backward parties most in need of reform </s>

<s> in any case all this helped to prepare for the militarist attitude that the party was to take when war came when it could advocate conscription without any fear of the electoral consequences </s>

<s> unionists had easy openings on defence issues for many unionist mps were exofficers but the experience of the country in the first two years of war suggests that their criticisms were not exaggerated </s>

<s> law had indeed already done enough as leader to make his departure unthinkable and so a memorial was drawn up by carson and signed by almost all the party s backbenchers stating full confidence in law and begging him to stay on with a revised tariff policy </s>
<s> relations with austen chamberlain were never quite the same and although only a handful of mps refused to sign the memorial they included personal friends of law like amery and aitken </s>
<s> behind the scenes efforts were being made to broaden the party s appeal by strengthening its policies for social reform the essential counterpoint to the theme of tariffs </s>
<s> this may have been due to the support of steelmaitland who was a founder member before he became party chairman and who later served on its committee on mental health </s>
<s> you have to establish your bona fides before you can be listened to </s>
<s> the committee had secured the services of some of the best experts available and had sent observers to examine social legislation abroad </s>

<s> there was no doubt that the liberals would press on with this timetable and little doubt that the labour and irish mps would support them unionists could not therefore stop home rule becoming law </s>
<s> the anger of the unionists was based partly on the old political frustration of government by logrolling and partly on a new constitutional point </s>
<s> the government made no effort to redeem this promise but unionists believed that they were in a temporary phase pending the reconstruction of the upper house and that it was therefore no business of the government to bring in other constitutional bills before they had settled the constitution itself </s>
<s> asquith replied that the question of mandates was not so simple but he was opposed to an election for the same reason as unionists wanted one both knew that home rule was not a winning policy outside ireland </s>

<s> unionists had a slight majority of the english borough seats but this was based on the small towns of the west and south rather than the heavy industrial centres of the north </s>
<s> of the major cities only birmingham liverpool and sheffield elected more unionists than liberals in 1910 but unionism was also strong in plymouth brighton preston and bath </s>

<s> few unionist mps had any need to earn their livings and it was usually the lawyers and businessmen who were the older members </s>
<s> this generation of new men might not have been elected but for the war but they would certainly have been trying to get elected in a general election in 1915 </s>
<s> the final characteristic of the mps that can be traced is religion which shows as traditional a pattern as any </s>
<s> there were rather more presbyterians a few roman catholics and jews and an overwhelmingly anglican majority at least 90 per cent of the party </s>
<s> but to exaggerate this would be to misjudge the tone of the party in religious affairs for if the church of england was the tory party at prayer then the party was also the church of england in politics </s>

<s> the dangers of dependence on rich men would be and were regularly pointed out if the local parties were not themselves independent then they would have to turn to rich outsiders to fight their elections for them as the times pointed out in 1911 </s>
<s> if the local organization after an election remained active on a permanent basis of annual subscription with a permanent organizing secretary who would attend to the registration work and become the agent at the next election a candidate could and probably would be selected on his merits and the constituency would be independent of men whose only merit was their wealth </s>

<s> the importance of the connexion graph is emphasised </s>
<s> some of the programs however are of the generalpurpose type </s>
<s> in this chapter we shall discuss certain characteristics and properties of matrices which are of particular importance in dynamical studies of systems with multiple degrees of freedom </s>
<s> an important property of a square matrix is its trace this is the sum of all the elements in the principal diagonal </s>
<s> wherever it saves space we shall always write a column vector x as the braces denote that this is to be read as a column </s>
<s> a square matrix having zeros everywhere except in the principal diagonal is called a diagonal matrix and is clearly symmetric </s>
<s> moreover or </s>
<s> any matrix may be partitioned by drawing dotted lines between adjacent columns and adjacent rows into submatrices </s>
<s> this is equivalent to vertical partitioning in b with conformable partitioning in c an example will make this clear </s>
<s> the product bc a could be where b is 4 × 5 c is 5 × 6 and a is 4 × 6 </s>
<s> it is important to note the conformability thus is 2 × 2 × 2 × 4 2 × 4 also and is also 2 × 4 </s>
<s> it is evident that though partitioning is largely arbitrary conformability both in multiplication and in addition is essential </s>
<s> in a square matrix a of order n the array of elements has a determinant which is in general nonzero this implies that the columns and the rows are linearly independent so that there is no nonzero column vector x such that ax vanishes </s>
<s> when the matrix a is said to be singular </s>
<s> we shall be much concerned in this text with matrices which are simply degenerate degeneracy 1 and with matrices in which all columns and all rows are proportional to each other in the latter case all secondorder minors vanish so that the rank is 1 </s>
<s> in general for a rectangular matrix the rank is the number of linearly independent rows and columns </s>
<s> this may be illustrated by a simple numerical example </s>
<s> if now we postmultiply the 3 × 2 submatrix of a by i we can add the last result to it to recover a as the matrix product finally a matrix of rank 1 can be expressed as the product of a column and a row in that order for such a matrix has effectively only one independent column all the other columns being proportional to it similarly for the rows </s>
<s> if is a square matrix of order n and if in the determinant the element has the cofactor that is the value of the determinant obtained from by deleting the ith row and jth column leaving a minor of order n 1 which is then multiplied by then by the rules for evaluation of determinants while since the summation in the latter result gives the value of a determinant having two equal rows </s>
<s> the matrix is called the adjugate of a if a is singular so that vanishes then in this case if a is simply degenerate is of rank 1 but if a is multiply degenerate so that all the cofactors of aij vanish for all i j then is null </s>
<s> we have just established the existence of a negative power of a square nonsingular matrix </s>
<s> in general any square matrix can be raised to any positive integral power by continued multiplication in any order by itself </s>
<s> 1 symmetric matrix characterised by a at </s>
<s> 3 diagonal matrix characterised by </s>
<s> we now establish an important property of diagonal matrices </s>
<s> thus the typical element of cd is while that of dc is </s>
<s> evidently such a matrix may be written multiplication by a scalar matrix therefore implies multiplication by a scalar quantity </s>
<s> 6 reversing matrix this is the square matrix having units in its secondary diagonal and zeros elsewhere it is written j postmultiplication of any matrix c by the conformable j matrix reverses the order of the columns of c while premultiplication by j reverses the order of the rows </s>
<s> an obvious and useful property of triangular matrices is that their determinants are simply the products of their diagonal terms </s>
<s> accordingly r is also lower triangular and its diagonal elements are as is otherwise obvious from consideration of the cofactors of a b c in l hence a computer program to find r needs to calculate only the n n 2 2 elements below the diagonal and these are found progressively </s>
<s> thus if a is persymmetric it is characterised by the typical element and hence has in general 2n 1 independent elements </s>
<s> 11 orthogonal matrices a square nonsingular matrix a having the property is said to be orthogonal </s>
<s> orthogonal matrices are of very great importance in dynamics </s>
<s> for example the matrix is orthogonal since it should be noted that the determinant of the above orthogonal matrix is unity in general an orthogonal matrix will have as its determinant since 12 hermitian and skewhermitian matrices if a matrix a has complex elements it can clearly be written in the form where b and c are real matrices and is the conjugate of a if b is symmetric and c is skewsymmetric a is said to be hermitian </s>
<s> evidently gives a row which is the sum of all the rows of a and ags sums all the columns of a its principal use is in the checking of numerical operations </s>
<s> finally when sets of differential equations are written in matrix form some of the matrices will be in effect operators </s>
<s> such a relation is called liner substitution </s>
<s> as a very simple example of a linear substitution consider the coordinates of a point p relative to two sets of axes mutually inclined at an angle evidently elimination of r gives and it should be noted that in this case the matrix of transformation is orthogonal </s>
<s> suppose however that a has degeneracy s </s>
<s> we may write this equation as equation 5 is known as a parametric solution since we have only n s independent relations we can determine only n s unknowns y in terms of the remaining s quantities z which may be regarded as arbitrary parameters in the problem </s>
<s> suppose we wish to express f in terms of new variables where then so that is the matrix of the new form </s>
<s> we say hat a and are connected by an equivalent transformation </s>
<s> for example from 1 above is the first element in the column ax the second etc so that in this text we shall be more concerned with quadratic forms obtained from bilinear forms such as when y x so that where a is now necessarily square </s>
<s> if a skewsymmetric transposition shows that vanishes </s>
<s> finally let be the unit matrix with the element substituted for the unit in the i ith position </s>
<s> then ilia multiplies the ith row of a by l a multiplies the ith column of a by l </s>
<s> the reciprocal of i is i itself since a double interchange of two rows restores the original matrix the reciprocal of i is also evidently i and that of </s>
<s> none of the operations i i j ik il in so far as they affect the minors can make a minor of order r 1 nonzero nor make the minor of order r vanish since they merely condense these minors </s>
<s> suppose we have a linear substitution ax y in which it is required that y be a scalar multiple of x say x </s>
<s> now by the usual rule for differentiation of determinants is linear and homogeneous in the first minors of gd </s>
<s> since vanishes but at least one first minor does not there must be n 1 independent columns the remaining column being expressible uniquely in terms of the independent columns </s>
<s> this means that there will be a vector x1 called an eigenvector such that and x1 is uniquely determined apart from an arbitrary scalar multiplier that is the ratios of the elements of x1 to each other are uniquely determined </s>
<s> if we revert to the original problem the solution of ax x we now see that there are just n eigenvalues s and that correspondingly there are just n vectors xs ie we have n equations we can combine them all into the single equation or more briefly ax x where x is ow the square matrix made up of the n column vectors xs and is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues and our problem is now to find the matrices x and for the given a </s>
<s> this expresses the fact that the columns of x are each arbitrary to a scalar multiplier since in xd x1 is multiplied by the scalar d1 and so on </s>
<s> the matrix equation arises perhaps most commonly in the study of the natural frequencies and modes of vibration of an undamped mechanical system having n degrees of freedom </s>
<s> if then b is said to be derived from a by a similar transformation </s>
<s> we shall give an example of the utility of 10 later 29 </s>
<s> since both and gd i are lambdamatrices we amy write them as polynomials in with matrix coefficients let us write the equation as then on multiplying out and identifying coefficients of we have premultiply the first of these relations by the second by etc and add the result is a 0 </s>
<s> equations 1163 and 1164 show that the characteristic equation may be written in the alternative forms it follows that the cayleyhamilton theorem can be written in the alternative form in which for consistency each factor has been multiplied by 1 it will be observed that with eigenvalues all different each of these matrices has degeneracy 1 the product of all n factors having degeneracy n ie it is null this is an illustration of sylvester s law of degeneracy theorem xii of 122 </s>
<s> we thus establish sylvester s theorem for the expansion of pa viz where the unit rank matrices which are known as the constituent matrices of a have interesting and important properties </s>
<s> thus i as has been noted earlier in 116 is proportional to where is the adjugate of i a </s>
<s> ii we defined as hence this equation requires for all the rows and columns hence since the inner product scalar is unit </s>
<s> if this is done for all i and we write xn for xd then so that the modal matrix xn chosen in this way is orthogonal and we say that xn is the normalised for of the modal matrix </s>
<s> next consider the more general case when a is not symmetric but is expressed as the product of two symmetric factors </s>
<s> clearly we can not normalise x in this case to make both and unit matrices we say therefore that in this case x is biorthogonal or has a generalised orthogonal form </s>
<s> now the ith diagonal element of where the bracketed term is the quadratic form obtained from c with the ith eigenvector xi </s>
<s> for example a rigid body may have some of its motions constrained by springs but two or more unconstrained it will then have two or more equal zero frequencies </s>
<s> the canonical form obtained by a similar transformation of a matrix having equal eigenvalues when reduced to its simplest form has the eigenvalues in the principal diagonal with equal eigenvalues in groups elsewhere the matrix is null except that there may be units in the superdiagonal </s>
<s> thus for example a matrix of order 6 having three equal eigenvalues ga two equal eigenvalues gb and an unrepeated eigenvalue gg would have as its canonical form where each x may be zero or unity it occurs only within the submatrices containing groups of equal eigenvalues </s>
<s> suppose we wish to remove the unit from the superdiagonal in the matrix by means of a similar transformation we can write the most general transformation matrix as then and if both offdiagonal elements are to vanish then provided we may satisfy 4 and for example if we choose </s>
<s> hence if a unit exists it may not in the superdiagonal element adjacent to two equal eigenvalues it can not be removed by a similar transformation </s>
<s> evidently the introduction of a unit reduces the degeneracy of i c by unity </s>
<s> then y must not vanish </s>
<s> for example if the eigenvalues are numerically small a unit could dominate the spectral matrix or if they are very large a unit could be of the order of the errors in the computation </s>
<s> we shall not attempt to deal with the full problem of multiple equal eigenvalues it will be sufficient in general to consider the case of two equal roots 1 2 as typical </s>
<s> if we cancel one factor from both sides we can write and then as before we can prove that </s>
<s> let put 2 and in the characteristic matrix then since by inspection it is doubly degenerate </s>
<s> if a reduced characteristic equation exists so that then also vanish and as in 11 we may now express powers of a or polynomials in a as polynomials in a of degree one less than that of </s>
<s> also if i a is postmultiplied by 111 it vanishes </s>
<s> since 2i b and i b are both simply degenerate we can find only one vector for each to satisfy they are respectively see 6 124 and 111 </s>
<s> then satisfies 10 </s>
<s> we now examine the origins of which in relation to b we call an auxiliary vector </s>
<s> we can and indeed must choose x1 as one of these for sine vanishes so evidently does and then is the other </s>
<s> it is now clear that to make up x we require i an eigenvector x1 satisfying ii an auxiliary vector satisfying iii an eigenvector x3 satisfying in the numerical example 10 and postmultiplication by x1 124 makes both vanish postmultiplication by 10 1 annihilates the second but not the first the product yields x1 </s>
<s> there is one further point of importance is not unique but contains an arbitrary element </s>
<s> in the critical case when ge vanishes we have two equal eigenvalues gm but i b0 is still simply degenerate thus and so the column makes this vanish </s>
<s> with general we may write the eigenvectors corresponding to respectively hence the operation and is converted to the standard canonical form for matrices with distinct eigenvalues </s>
<s> the two matrices and are both equivalent to and to each other they are each derived from by a similar transformation </s>
<s> them treating a first we have as in 118 the expansion can then proceed as before and we obtain where are unit rank matrices </s>
<s> these matrices satisfy </s>
<s> we append here some useful theorems and definitions theorem 1 the reciprocal of the transpose of a matrix a is equal to the transpose of the reciprocal of a for transpose to get </s>
<s> by progressive expansion of the diagonal minors it therefore appears that the two leading terms in the full expansion are now if we write the determinant as the leading terms are hence example ii let and on expansion then theorem iii the product of the eigenvalues of a is </s>
<s> in put </s>
<s> hence if an eigenvalue of a is zero a is singular and conversely if then one or more eigenvalues are zero </s>
<s> this is immediately obvious from the identity the sum of the eigenvalues and tr a are each increased by example iv let us add 3 to each diagonal element of the matrix a in examples ii and iii we obtain and </s>
<s> hence compared with example i the eigenvalues have each been reduced by and </s>
<s> thus is expressible as the product of two symmetric matrices </s>
<s> if we put and hence k i the two factors in 4 reduce to those given in 119 </s>
<s> then takes the numerical values x being the same as in case a </s>
<s> if we take determinants and note that we have in reverse order we find so that and hence </s>
<s> if a b an c are matrices of order n × p p × q and q × n respectively the nonzero eigenvalues of abc n × n cab q × q and bca p × p are identical </s>
<s> in 8 write multiply out and separate real and imaginary parts </s>
<s> finally and with the given conditions is therefore real finite and nonnegative </s>
<s> householder s formula relates to the more general case where a matrix of rank is added to a the additional modifying matrix may be written crt with c of order n × p and rt of order p × n </s>
<s> the reader might verify this useful formula in which it is evident that the inverse of a matrix of order n is obtained in terms of that of a matrix of smaller order </s>
<s> in this case 12 becomes successively and 13 yields hence as before we have proved in theorem viii that with these conditions x is real hence 15 implies p 0 and as before a is not defective </s>
<s> ii a defective matrix can not be similarly transformed into a real symmetric matrix </s>
<s> with p 0 these satisfy 15 </s>
<s> this example not only illustrates sylvester s law it also makes the important point that the degeneracy of the product depends on the relative positions of the units and therefore of the linearly independent columns in the two factors </s>
<s> finally suppose </s>
<s> this establishes the second part of sylvester s theorem </s>
<s> hence f so that and now put xn 0 </s>
<s> we now consider three cases </s>
<s> a the eigenvalues of a are all different </s>
<s> b a is nondefective but has some repeated eigenvalues </s>
<s> this establishes the theorem as stated </s>
<s> let a real symmetric matrix a be rendered diagonal by a congruent transformation where b is of course nonsingular </s>
<s> if we now take a similar argument leads to the same result q p </s>
<s> since the argument does not depend on the nature of x and l the result is generally true and the theorem established </s>
<s> it may be noted that </s>
<s> this method is the simplest and probably the most universally used </s>
<s> in writing down we have first arbitrarily selected a nonzero element of a as a pivot underlined for this first step in the operation </s>
<s> the third column of b is then null except for a unit in the position corresponding to </s>
<s> having obtained b we now select a pivotal element in it for the next step the selection is arbitrary except that the element must be nonzero and must not be in the second row which contains the unit </s>
<s> when we use as a premultiplier of 1 we combine the rows of i in exactly the same ways as those of a we can therefore write the two arrays side by side and operate on rows of 2n elements </s>
<s> first it is possible to operate with columns using postmultiplying matrices mi but this is really only transposition of operations on rows </s>
<s> the third has the advantage that no final rearrangement of rows is required on the other hand it fails if a pivot becomes zero or even very small </s>
<s> it is to be observed that the determinant of a is readily found from the condensation procedure </s>
<s> since the total number of crossings 5 is odd has the determinant 1 accordingly coincidentally this example also illustrates he second variant it is adventitious that the largest element among those available occurs in the first second third and fourth column in succession </s>
<s> in this example therefore the second variant has the advantage in a matrix of large order the scanning process can take considerable computer time </s>
<s> no scanning is needed in the third variant where the diagonal elements are prescribed </s>
<s> we now treat the same matrix by the third variant see table 3 </s>
<s> the student is invited to effect this reciprocation by means of the fourth variant in which the largest diagonal element available is chosen as the pivot at each stage it begins with the bottom righthand element </s>
<s> b suppose we have a matrix b of which we know the reciprocal b is now bordered so that it becomes a submatrix of a larger matrix a and we require a1 </s>
<s> various formulae are possible but the most advantageous from the computational standpoint appear to be the following </s>
<s> although it is very small we may use the matrix a of equation 2214 to illustrate the principles involved </s>
<s> since an element in the reciprocal of a matrix m is defined as the ratio of the cofactor of the corresponding element in m to the determinant it follows that for example and hence in this example therefore </s>
<s> then it is possible using 1 so to choose etc that ao is transformed into a when a last simple calculation gives the method has many variants we can build a column by column or row by row or column and row simultaneously </s>
<s> triangulation has many important uses </s>
<s> if we divide each row through by its diagonal element 1 becomes the leading matrix here is of the form i c where c is null except for the elements above the diagonal </s>
<s> write then inversion of this and premultiplication of the result by r1 gives provided as r increases </s>
<s> the number of matrix multiplications in this procedure is the same as before but the squaring of etc is usually relatively easy since they become rapidly smaller in practice </s>
<s> a rather more rapid method is to write 5 as for the simple reciprocation of a matrix a these methods hardly compete with pivotal condensation however they do have a place in the parallel problem of solution of linear algebraic equations </s>
<s> now if b1 is the same as r1 so that the methods are effectively the same </s>
<s> this result shows that although in 1 no restriction is placed on b it must in practice be a reasonable approximation to if the method is to converge </s>
<s> we illustrate equation 6 here </s>
<s> let here we have chosen b as the lower triangular portion of a and c is of course b a we are given that to four places of decimals we now find and to this order of accuracy is null </s>
<s> b is then reciprocated as in 198 an the methods of the last paragraph applied </s>
<s> the example given there is in fact an illustration of seidel iteration </s>
<s> here b is chosen to be the diagonal matrix of the diagonal elements of a its reciprocal can therefore be written down </s>
<s> certain matrices have properties which make reciprocation rather easier than would otherwise be the case </s>
<s> for if a is symmetric and we transpose ar i to get then evidently see also 122 theorem i corollary </s>
<s> also when is reached this gives the last row of r and hence also the last column so that the eighth elements in can be written down and so on </s>
<s> next and so on </s>
<s> here a is in general a rectangular matrix of order m × n with given elements p is a given column of m elements and x a column of n unknowns it is required to find x </s>
<s> if 1 is soluble there must be n independent equations if these are written first we can partition 1 in the form where b is square and nonsingular </s>
<s> we now obtain the partial solution for x in which we determine m of the unknowns x in terms of b c p and the remaining m n unknowns z </s>
<s> this is the parametric solution of 110 </s>
<s> we now confine our attention to the case where a is square and nonsingular this is obviously germane to the above solutions </s>
<s> we can therefore obtain our solution by inverting using any of the methods of 22 23 and postmultiplying the inverse by p </s>
<s> in some problems we require to obtain x for each of a set of values for p eg the elements of p may be functions of an independent variable and we require x for each of a number of values of the variable </s>
<s> we exemplify the general iteration procedure of 232 we write b c for a where the reciprocal of b is known or easily obtained </s>
<s> resolution of into implies a cb where c is an orthogonal matrix so that </s>
<s> suppose we wish to solve as in 242 we can quickly resolve the square matrix into a selfexplanatory scheme for computation is shown in table 1 </s>
<s> in 25 we noted that if we have more equations than unknowns the equations must be consistent or a unique solution does not exist </s>
<s> the least squares solution of this problem is due to gauss </s>
<s> we are given a and p e will vary with x </s>
<s> however if we premultiply 6 by at as in 4 we get and the solution by inspection is x 1 21 ie if we now return to 6 and use this solution we find which compares very favourably with the result given earlier </s>
<s> let us first examine the straight gaussian solution </s>
<s> the result is and premultiplication of this by yields to two decimal places </s>
<s> in equation 261 we arbitrarily assign n 2 different values to other than 0 which we have in effect used to determine pn and then evaluate the numerical determinant for each of these </s>
<s> as before we can find independently if we so wish </s>
<s> sylvester s expansion for a is see 118 in its simplest form and in view of the properties of the constituent matrices since the order of the terms on the right is immaterial there is no loss of generality i supposing1 to be the eigenvalue of greatest modulus </s>
<s> thus if r is increased sufficiently say to a value s the first term on the right of 2 dominates the rest which become relatively insignificant </s>
<s> also the inner product is so that normalising to make unity note that so that a has been raised fairly rapidly to a high power </s>
<s> there is however an alternative device which is in practice more commonly used this is repeated premultiplication by a of an arbitrary column as in 262 </s>
<s> the first step is proceeding in this way we find successive columns as in table 1 </s>
<s> we may note in passing that as they should the columns and of table 1 agree with the last columns of b c d e f subject to roundingoff errors in the last place of decimals </s>
<s> now provided the eigenvalues are reasonably separated column iterations usually number between 15 and 50 </s>
<s> again for the moment we assume the eigenvalues of a to be real and unrepeated and we assume that in 2711 they appear in descending order of modulus </s>
<s> the process of reducing a in this way is known as deflation </s>

<s> instead of operating with a deflated matrix we operate on the original matrix a or a part of it with a column vector from which all contributions from x1 have been swept away </s>

<s> for example with hindsight we know that the eigenvalues of a in 2611 are 25 125 5 and 25 the rapidity of convergence of the initial power solution depends principally on the relative separation of the eigenvalues 25 and 125 ie 21 </s>

<s> knowing 1 we now form the matrix 1i a if we put r 01 in 13 multiply the first by 1 and then subtract the second premultiplication of this by or postmultiplication by x1 annihilates it none of the other vectors does so the matrix is rendered simply degenerate by the presence of z12 </s>

<s> the reader is invited to evaluate lp using the numerical values of 5 in 6 and in particular to note that the eigenvector belonging to the zero root is that originally associated with the eigenvalues 25 in 2726 </s>
<s> this is however usually a very long process and while it can be accelerated by shifting and deflation it is in fact better to depopulate a below the diagonal as far as possible as an initial step </s>

<s> it remains to explain how qi is chosen </s>
<s> there are various possibilities the most popular methods are those of givens and householder 6 </s>
<s> here we describe givens method and as before for simplicity of exposition we choose n 4 </s>
<s> then if we evaluate as a chain beginning by premultiplying a by the last of the three matrices in 4 and if also we take then a is first replaced by a matrix in which the leading element of the infradiagonal vanishes </s>
<s> when the multiplications are carried out in the order indicated the upper hessenberg form is maintained throughout if however we begin by multiplying the central three matrices the upper hessenberg form is lost with a accompanying loss of simplicity </s>
<s> equation 4 employs one matrix for each nonzero element below the diagonal three in this case n 1 in general </s>
<s> there are thus 2n 2 multiplications in each iteration </s>
<s> the result is a new matrix we now with hindsight use a shift of 02 ie we work with the matrix a 02i </s>
<s> shifts are always used to improve convergence this particular shift requires only one step </s>
<s> if complex eigenvalues exist double shifts see wilkinson 6 may be made and two qr steps performed simultaneously to give rapid convergence while all arithmetic is kept real </s>
<s> if on the other hand one or more auxiliary vectors are required so that the spectral matrix takes the form then the pencil is defective </s>

<s> if we set up a regression formula or companion matrix for the cubic we find the next factor to be 1 as we have already noted </s>
<s> we now look briefly at the eigenvectors </s>
<s> if using p1 we now find an eigenvalue 2 06 and the associated eigenvector then and then we may calculate which with b1 given by 6 yields by inspection b2 is doubly degenerate it is of course annihilated by postmultiplication by or </s>
<s> a third deflation would produce b3 a unit rank matrix which in this instance n 4 would be the last term in 3 </s>

<s> as a result calculation of the last two or three eigenvalues in may not be very accurate </s>
<s> in these circumstances use of the collarjahn method described in chapter 3 may greatly expedite the solution </s>

<s> in equation 1 let </s>
<s> suppose we are given an approximate eigenvalue </s>
<s> if we round this off to a new we quickly find that also ie 40 is an exact eigenvalue also the corresponding eigenvector becomes </s>
<s> hence see also 16 in close agreement with 16 </s>
<s> as before we choose λ as an independent variable assign the value unity to and zeros to the first n 1 elements of g we also write remembering that a is not symmetric </s>
<s> this is the parallel to 210112 as before we can if we wish use g as given by 7 for alternative treatment but we shall not pursue this here </s>
<s> in equation 21021 we derived a as the product of two given symmetric matrices and b this was done for convenience in the examples </s>
<s> here we obtain the most general solution </s>
<s> we first continue the discussion of §119 and treat the most common case in which a has distinct eigenvalues </s>
<s> it was shown there that a permutes with which is therefore diagonal </s>
<s> this diagonal matrix d is arbitrary since x is arbitrary to a postmultiplying diagonal matrix </s>
<s> now if see §118 we write c may now be expressed as so that c is expressible as an arbitrary linear sum of the n symmetric unit rank matrices </s>
<s> then a can be written with the 2 × 2 scalar submatrix αi in the leading diagonal position </s>
<s> this therefore contains three arbitrary quantities giving n 1 in all </s>
<s> finally suppose a has two equal eigenvalues α but is defective </s>
<s> accordingly with k as defined in theorem v of §122 </s>

<s> finally in relation to our main problem since for the rayleigh quotient which gives eigenvalues identical to those of a and since also p q r s are arbitrary it follows that i 1234 though this result is not particularly helpful in practice </s>

<s> in the course of this chapter we shall examine some of the uses of the term topic in the study of discourse </s>

<s> with the aid of this vector we can replace by where is the unit vector in the direction of point p at a radius r </s>
<s> this is a technique often used that leads to a quick and simple answer </s>
<s> for a large number of charges we sum up the contribution of each dipole moment </s>

<s> no we have done the same thing as before with the only difference that we calculated the potential instead of the electric field </s>
<s> we have taken an unphysical picture and we get a nonsensical answer </s>
<s> number one is to acknowledge the fact that our line charge is not infinitely long integrate between the limits h and h differentiate to obtain the electric field and let then h go to infinity </s>
<s> it probably matters little where we choose that point as long as it is not at infinity </s>
<s> is there another more direct way of determining the electric field </s>
<s> if the line charge is infinitely long so that the field depends on the radius only we can choose our gaussian surface as a cylinder wrapped round the line charge fig 211 </s>

<s> we shall now investigate the case when the charge is uniformly distributed over a plane the x y plane in fig 212 </s>

<s> for a class of materials called conductors the internal charge distribution may be looked upon as a cloud of mobile negative particles in the background of immobile positive lattice ions </s>
<s> when the voltage is applied there is initially an electric field inside the conductor and the charges start to move under its influence </s>
<s> how far will they move under the influence of an attractive electric field </s>

<s> why </s>
<s> gauss s law is still valid by eqns 279 and 280 do not follow from it </s>

<s> so it is clear that our first approach demonstrated in fig 220 had no general validity </s>

<s> are there any general methods for solving eqn 293 </s>
<s> take u1 x1 and u2 x2 as conductor surfaces fig 225 then the y constant lines will represent the field lines </s>
<s> taking for example v 1 and 2 for the conductor surfaces we have solved an electrostatic problem as may be seen in fig 226 </s>

<s> according to fig 233b the electric field at a distance r from the charge is given by the negative sign is due to the fact that the direction of the electric field is opposite to the normal to the plane and consequently </s>
<s> dielectric boundaries </s>
<s> if we investigate a small enough part of the boundary between two arbitrary media we can always regard the boundary as a plane surface </s>
<s> we can get that by taking this time the line integral of the electric field along both sides of the boundary as shown in fig 238 </s>
<s> the field lines as expected refract when entering the dielectric for a mathematical solution in terms of images see clemmow 1973 </s>
<s> a dielectric sphere inserted into a homogeneous electric field in air or a vacuum attracts the field lines </s>

<s> the transition from discrete to distributed charge can be made as follows q1 is replaced by and the summation by integration yielding where the volume r must contain all the charges </s>
<s> this is a perfectly reasonable procedure but we have to admit that eqn 2116 is rarely used </s>

<s> you are certainly entitled to think in terms of charges and potentials </s>
<s> in order to create a charge distribution a certain amount of work has to be done and that is available to us in the form of electrostatic energy </s>
<s> let us work out as an example the stored energy of a parallelplate capacitor </s>

<s> let us distinguish two cases </s>

<s> in practice however the beam is not uniform and does not possess perfect cylindrical symmetry </s>
<s> under these conditions the motion of the particles is fairly complicated and of course our model is unable to predict the detailed behaviour of the particles </s>
<s> naturally if the ions attract the electrons the converse is true as well ie owing to the magnetic force on the electrons there is also an inward force upon the ions </s>
<s> will there be a magnetic field </s>
<s> but the effect of the magnetic field upon the motion of the electrons is nearly always negligible one exception causing the pinch effect is mentioned in the previous section </s>
<s> risking the dismay of circuit engineers some theoreticians do in fact refer to eqn 335 as ohm s law </s>
<s> electron flow between parallel plates j p e d </s>
<s> we can reduce the problem to a onedimensional one by claiming that the plates are infinitely large </s>
<s> whichever way we look at it we can disregard with clear conscience both the radial electric field and the magnetic field </s>
<s> assuming now that the electrons are emitted with zero initial velocity v0 0 we get </s>
<s> in this example the charges are in motion and the charge density varies from point to point but the density at a given point z is not dependent on time </s>
<s> hence we are faced here with an electrostatic problem which may be solved with the aid of poisson s equation eqn 212 </s>

<s> hence if the current is everywhere in the azimuthal direction the vector potential must be in the same direction too </s>
<s> if you look up the relevant books you will find that eqn 356 may be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals </s>
<s> all that is easily digestible </s>
<s> noting that we get for the components of the magnetic field </s>
<s> on the basis of this analogy we may call a ring current a magnetic dipole or more precisely we should say that sufficiently far away from a ring current the magnetic field appears as if it was created by two closely spaced magnetic charges which of course do not exist </s>
<s> if the solenoid is very long la then and </s>
<s> we may then apply ampère s law to the path shown in fig 38 yielding it is a bit of a coincidence that eqns 371 and 372 agree </s>
<s> the reason is that in the latter approach the magnetic field is overestimated near the ends inside the solenoid and underestimated outside the solenoid </s>
<s> the answer is not quite because the boundary conditions are not quite the same </s>
<s> hence fig 241 p 47 is a valid representation for magnetic materials as well </s>

<s> integrating eqn 43 over a surface and applying stokes s theorem to the lefthand side we get where the line integral is over the closed contour of the chosen surface </s>
<s> using the definition of magnetic flux eqn 322 the above equation may be written in the form </s>

<s> we need something else besides the scalar potential for describing correctly a timevarying electric field </s>
<s> for the static case by definition </s>
<s> it is no longer unambiguous to talk about the voltage between two points </s>
<s> for the static case the line integral of the electric field disappears when taken over a closed path </s>
<s> it is rather unfortunate to call it a force because it is nt one </s>
<s> when the closed path is in a wire loop and the loop is in motion then a force due to the magnetic field is present as well giving rise to a finite amount of work in the same manner </s>
<s> 42 </s>
<s> let us consider a twodimensional case where the magnetic field at a given moment is constant within a cylinder of radius a and is zero outside this cylinder </s>
<s> we find by inspection that the solutions are </s>
<s> it follows from eqn 49 that it is finite if the path encloses the timevarying flux but zero otherwise </s>
<s> it is still true that whether we regard e as the original field without the contribution of the charges or as if ec were added to the original field </s>
<s> so what is the voltage we are going to measure </s>
<s> if we connect the loops then the total induced voltage will be the algebraic sum of the individual voltages </s>
<s> if we make up a helical coil fig 42b the wires are going round always in the same direction so the voltages simply add and we may rewrite eqn 413 in the form where is the flux enclosed by each turn </s>
<s> the force on the mobile charges is still qe but now the charges may follow the electric field all the way around the ring </s>
<s> note however that the electric field is different on sections 1 and 3 and the line integrals on sections 2 and 4 vanish altogether because the path is perpendicular to the electric field </s>
<s> the tangential component of the electric field along the wire </s>
<s> according to eqn 42 that is not possible </s>
<s> it means in our case the same that commonsense would suggest that the current in the loop must everywhere be the same </s>

<s> there will be a current produced by the electric field as before the new feature is the appearance of a qv x b force on each charge element </s>
<s> it is the same story again </s>
<s> the externally impressed voltage need not come from a timevarying magnetic field as in the previous section it may be produced by a signal generator </s>
<s> for this reason it is often called a back emf </s>
<s> so the problem is pretty complicated </s>
<s> reference books give the answer where d is the diameter of the wire </s>
<s> in general r is the resistance of the circuit and l may be obtained from eqn 433 where is the flux enclosed by the circuit </s>
<s> can one determine the inductance of any of the practical configurations with relative ease </s>
<s> we get the flux per unit length by integrating the flux density over the space between the wires assumed to be infinitely thin as follows </s>
<s> what s wrong </s>
<s> is this the total flux </s>
<s> then the magnetic field inside the material from eqn 372 is uniform across the crosssection of area s0 of the core </s>
<s> i am afraid the above formulae are wrong because our new solenoids do nt look the same as the old one </s>
<s> it might be simpler to find the total energy in space than the flux crossing a given surface </s>
<s> if is timevarying the voltage induced in loop 2 is m di1 dt </s>
<s> assuming now that all the flux produced by coil 1 will pass through coil 2 as well we get for the voltage in coil 2 whence </s>
<s> thus when some flux leaks away eqn 452 becomes an inequality </s>
<s> alternatively one may introduce a coupling coefficient and rewrite eqns 452 and 453 in the form </s>
<s> for the mutual inductance it is not needed </s>
<s> as you know any electromagnetic disturbance any change in anything propagates with the velocity of light something we have so far neglected to take into account </s>
<s> when calculating the mutual inductance we assumed that the magnetic field due to i1 appears instantaneously at the second ring </s>
<s> if the current i1 may be considered constant during the time then we are entitled to talk about slow variation </s>
<s> for sinusoidal current variation the condition is that the period of oscillation t should be much larger than </s>
<s> kinetic inductance </s>
<s> we have defined inductance by eqn 433 without discussing its effect upon the currentvoltage relationship </s>
<s> as the above story shows it is often difficult to think of the obvious </s>
<s> hence the current will necessarily lag behind the voltage causing its rise </s>
<s> we shall write up newton s equation for the case when the force is provided by an electric field and friction is present where k is a constant characterizing friction to be related presently to more familiar constants </s>
<s> we may formally write where is the kinetic resistance and is the kinetic inductance </s>
<s> whether one defines a conductance or introduces a friction term they are just two different ways of expressing the empirical fact that the electrons velocity does not go on increasing indefinitely in response to a driving electric field </s>
<s> no in deriving eqn 461 we have not talked about magnetic fields and induction at all </s>
<s> because under normal circumstances this kinetic inductance is negligible </s>
<s> comparing eqns 463 and 464 you may see that lk rkk and if you determine k from the identity you will find for copper that </s>
<s> assuming for the moment that all the flux is contained within the magnetic core so that the amount of flux crossing coils 1 and 2 is the same the open circuit voltage in coil 2 is leading to the familiar relationship </s>
<s> the current in coil 1 may be obtained from the relationship </s>

<s> as our first example we shall take a straight piece of wire moving perpendicularly to the direction of a static magnetic field </s>
<s> as a consequence there will be a force qv x b acting on the charges in the wire the mobile charges will be displaced until the arising electric field produces an equal and opposite force </s>
<s> we have started by writing down maxwell s equations and claimed that they will provide the solution to any electromagnetic problem </s>
<s> according to our equations a magnetic field whether it moves or not can not produce a force on a stationary charge </s>
<s> in order to tackle the present problem we should change to a coordinate system moving with the magnetic field </s>
<s> one may argue that by moving the magnetic field nothing has changed at the position of the wire </s>
<s> the above argument is wrong do nt let yourself be misled </s>
<s> induction is not a local phenomenon </s>
<s> although it does not follow that the electric field is also zero at x 0 the curl of the electric field must be zero but not the electric field itself </s>
<s> the electric field will then produce just the right force for displacing the electrons by the right amount </s>
<s> faraday s law </s>
<s> for simplicity we shall further assume that the length of the loop in the y direction is smaller than the period of the magnetic field </s>
<s> the flux enclosed is then and the resulting emf is </s>

<s> some direct access devices have available storage areas starting from 00 000 or 00001 and addressed by a simple number </s>
<s> however the conversion from a numeric useraddress to a device address in terms of cylinders and records is carried out by the manufacturer s software and thus involves an overhead of both primary storage space and cpu time </s>
<s> in this case to allow for the increment not being unity the relationship becomes where α and β are constants </s>
<s> hh is a twocharacter head number </s>
<s> for example a file is to be stored on a 3380 disk fourteen records per track starting at cylinder 23 </s>
<s> integer arithmetic should be used to avoid the problems of approximate answers </s>
<s> no other file organization can achieve this so it is worth accepting a fairly low packing density to retain the file in this form </s>
<s> in the latter case addressing will probably only point to a bucket number and in searching the bucket for a particular record using the direct technique it will no longer be an error to detect a dummy record but part of the search </s>
<s> this process requires a table of 2849 entries each showing the cumulative total of records up to the start of that set </s>

<s> the situation is modified when records are stored in buckets holding several records but synonyms still occur </s>
<s> a different set of keys will produce a different set of synonyms and of unused record spaces </s>
<s> if 4000 records are stored in 5000 addresses then only one algorithm in every will achieve this which rules out a search for a perfect randomizing algorithm on a trialanderror basis </s>
<s> some will answer 3652 or 183 for safety </s>
<s> let the number of records be defined as n and the total address locations as n this corresponds with the symbols used in equation 61 </s>
<s> as a result of n records being allocated the probability of a given location having been allocated x records is given by the terms of the binomial expression thus this expression is precise </s>
<s> we shall look at ways of choosing a more suitable packing density in more detail later see p 172 </s>
<s> there might also be a departmental or other code in the centre of the key and we might obtain all the records in three areas starting with numbers such as 03 05 or 07 if the choice of storage address is unfortunate </s>
<s> this technique can however give very good results if the low order digits of the key are consecutive integers with few gaps </s>
<s> a tendigit key such as 1 234 567 890 may be reduced to fit 50 000 storage positions by carrying out the steps this method is fairly effective </s>
<s> it destroys the original key pattern more completely than operations 1 and 2 above but retains the ability to separate keys that are part of consecutive runs </s>
<s> for example if we have 98 000 positions of storage in which to store the records from 50 001 to 148 000 we could carry out the following calculation the record address is 124 790 </s>
<s> it turns out that any number divided by 98 000 will give a remainder with the last three digits unchanged as 98000 itself is divisible by 1000 </s>
<s> for that reason a divisor should be chosen that is not itself divisible by 2 3 5 10 or any of their simple multiples </s>
<s> in our example the divisor is divisible by 1000 which leads to three unchanged digits </s>
<s> the logical extension of avoiding multiples of 2 3 5 10 etc is to use a large prime number </s>
<s> so long as two key sequences do not produce overlapping remainders this can achieve results considerably better than true randomization </s>

<s> the number of synonyms resulting from this process should be compared with those to be expected from perfect randomization see p 166 for methods of doing this </s>
<s> in selecting a prime number primes of the form should be avoided where b is the number base and k a small integer </s>
<s> this tendency remains for small integer values of k reducing as k increases in size </s>
<s> many of these are suitable only for table searching in main storage but the principles are of interest to direct file designers </s>
<s> this technique is not always as effective as division but does achieve a nearly random distribution and so is useful when it is not possible to exploit any existing order in the key sequence </s>
<s> primary clustering results from runs of keys in that they will be allocated to adjacent storage positions after division this is dispersed by quadratic hashing in which the final storage position of the record depends on a function of the remainder from the original division summed with a function of the square of the remainder </s>

<s> the reader might like to check that if the second and third digits are used instead of the third and fourth there will be seven synonyms instead of eight 00 01 01 04 09 12 12 </s>

<s> to provide quick reference for the file designer the data in table 65 has been plotted in fig 611 </s>
<s> there are three widely used methods of doing this and we shall look at each in turn assessing their advantages and drawbacks </s>
<s> the simplest method of storage is to place a synonym in the first vacant record position following its home address </s>
<s> very few records will not find a place anywhere on the cylinder </s>
<s> in this case the cylinder can be treated as a very large bucket </s>
<s> this points to the second record that randomized to the home address </s>
<s> the calculations involved in assessing the effect of chaining synonyms are complicated </s>
<s> of these onesixth 003 per cent will be home records and an equal number will be first second third fourth and fifth synonyms </s>
<s> at this packing density the average search time for a given record is 0732r where r is the device rotation time </s>
<s> buckets can hold ten records only and any further records allocated to a bucket will become part of a synonym chain </s>
<s> this can occur when adding records to the file </s>
<s> an example of the situation where there are five synonyms for a home record is shown in fig 615 </s>
<s> 1 </s>
<s> although the tags will point to the required record addresses directly accessing or retrieving these synonyms requires a head movement of at least one cylinder </s>
<s> this will mean an increase in the average access time of 00014r </s>
<s> this would happen as shown in fig 617 </s>
<s> this depends on the manufacturers software </s>
<s> investigated the performance of a number of large files and the author has analysed their results further </s>
<s> if it is unavoidable chaining should be employed assuming of course that the packing density is too high and bucket size too small to make consecutive spill attractive </s>
<s> although many writers recommend it it is seldom worth using such a separate overflow area when the packing density is below unity </s>
<s> the 8020 arrangement </s>
<s> this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of possible situations the intention is to show how to tackle any distribution that occurs in practice </s>
<s> in examining the effect of the patterns defined above random influences will be ignored </s>
<s> each of the three cases will be examined for 90 per cent packed files randomized to individual record positions and to a bucket that can hold ten records </s>
<s> however as the first fifth of the file 20 per cent only contained 8483 per cent of synonyms the fourfifths of the file loaded later must have a higher average number of synonyms than 34063 to bring the overall average to that figure </s>
<s> it should be made clear both that a b does not need to add up to 100 it is an unfortunate chance that the 8020 or 9010 rules are so well known and that access frequency loading will only be of benefit when a is less than b if a were greater than b meaning that the less active records were loaded first file access times would be poorer than those of randomly loaded files </s>
<s> the percentage of synonyms when a per cent of the file has been loaded is </s>
<s> the results show that a 90 per cent packed file of this type loaded in access frequency order into single record buckets will achieve a reduction from 3406 down to 1663 per cent references to synonyms </s>
<s> however a small group of records have been accessed over 120 times and another small group less than ten times </s>
<s> to analyse this the frequency curve in fig 622 case 3 is constructed relating the percentage of accesses to the file to the percentage of records loaded at any cumulative percentage of records loaded using the methods shown in appendix 8 </s>
<s> the cumulative frequency curves for all three cases analysed earlier are shown in fig 622 </s>
<s> the deterioration to be expected has been analysed by the author and results for the 8020 case are given here </s>
<s> fig 623 shows the results of additions of average access frequency to an access frequency loaded file </s>
<s> the dashed curves trace the results of a full access frequency load to 100 per cent packing while the unbroken curves show the effect of adding records of average activity from the packing densities set into each curve </s>
<s> in reality as pointed out above these curves are likely to represent a best case as additions to a file are usually new customers products personnel etc and tend to be highly active while they also have a high probability of being synonyms </s>
<s> these are provided for convenience but the designer can use the charts from any point and the slope of the broken lines indicates the rate of deterioration to be expected </s>
<s> selfindexed files will need little or no prior formatting of the direct access device on which they are to be stored </s>
<s> if the records are to be stored in full track buckets no formatting is required as the track address is available at all times </s>
<s> some manufacturers provide preformatted buckets of various sizes on a track </s>
<s> load the file </s>
<s> if new records are added faster than old records are deleted the packing of the file will get higher as we saw earlier in the chapter this will cause more synonyms </s>
<s> van der pool described what he called the ageing process in direct files pointing out that performance degrades over time due to additions even if the packing density does not change </s>
<s> it is helpful to keep a count of references to home and synonym records </s>
<s> the first is to have a count field in each record and increment it each time the record is accessed </s>
<s> it is to set up an ancillary file with the records in sequential key order and each record consisting only of a count field </s>
<s> a boeing 747 flight between london and new york will always be a candidate for a home position </s>
<s> in that case it would also be likely to merit a larger aircraft </s>
<s> in some cases no clear pattern emerges </s>
<s> this may be zero though in multiprogramming or multitasking it is likely to be finite </s>
<s> if a file is selfindexed this presents no problem </s>
<s> a list of keys in sequential order is fed into the program and the keys are transformed into addresses in the usual way </s>
<s> additions or deletions can change this situation </s>
<s> this is particularly important if records </s>
<s> despite the extra work involved in moving records about to ensure that all possible records are held in their home addresses compared with the less restrictive requirement of at least one home record discussed earlier this stricter file housekeeping pays off when retrievals outnumber additions and deletions </s>
<s> this only applies for files that are relatively fully loaded a 50 per cent packed file would require approximately equal numbers of accesses for addition and reference </s>
<s> the fulltrack bucket but singlerecord storage remains a good option in this case </s>
<s> direct files have been used less than might be expected in data processing </s>
<s> however for enquiry systems with no sequential requirement or when that requirement is minimal a welldesigned direct file will outperform a welldesigned indexedsequential file often very substantially </s>
<s> the probable reason that indexed sequential files are so often used when direct files would perform better is the ready availability of software </s>
<s> direct files require extensive design work because every file and every algorithm will differ slightly from every other </s>
<s> randomizing algorithms are sometimes provided but it is generally wise for the user to allocate and test them for each file on an individual basis </s>
<s> this chapter has shown the steps that can be taken to ensure that a direct file is optimized and if the file designer follows the rules laid down here good results should be obtained in almost any situation </s>
<s> such a need could be met by processing the whole file sequentially and looking for the records required but this would be very inefficient </s>
<s> if the file is large the query may take some time to answer meanwhile the computer is occupied processing unwanted records rather than doing useful work </s>
<s> a second technique that greatly improves the speed of searching a sequential file is to use a logarithmic search </s>
<s> a sequential data file that is indexed is called an indexed sequential file </s>
<s> the facilities provided by this type of file usually include </s>
<s> 3 </s>
<s> properly used such a file provides an excellent compromise between the extremes of sequential processing with very rare enquiries that is best handled by sequential files and direct processing with very infrequent sequential processing for which direct files are most suitable </s>
<s> the main case in which full indexing is useful is that in which individual records take up a whole track in ibm terminology or sufficient buckets or sectors eight fifteen or twentyfive in icl 2900 series terms depending on the disk in question to fill a track completely </s>
<s> all the common direct access devices whether disk semiconductor disk or mass storage device have a track concept that is important in deciding on the best arrangement of indexes </s>
<s> the following calculations assume that indexes are stored on a direct access device </s>
<s> assume first that i 2 is one track or less in extent </s>
<s> a search will therefore take the minimum time shown in fig 72 </s>
<s> the breakeven point is therefore two tracks if there is no requirement to seek the start of the track or three tracks if there is </s>
<s> this process is repeated each time the highestlevel index existing at that time requires a third or fourth track to be added </s>
<s> this is not significant for less than three tracks as it is effectively the same as a sequential search for one or two tracks </s>
<s> a tree index is one in which the top level of the index which is the one consulted first in a search for a record points to lower levels of the index </s>
<s> this top level of the tree is often described as the root index of the tree while the lowerlevel index items are equivalent to the branches of the tree and the records are often called leaves or nodes </s>
<s> a balanced tree is one in which any record can be retrieved in a number of steps s or s 1 that is the path length to the record varies by no more than one step </s>
<s> the order of the btree is said to be one more than the maximum number of keys per index block </s>
<s> a modified form of btree is used in ibm s vsam files to be discussed later in the chapter </s>
<s> indirectly btrees are also used in ibm s db2 relational database system </s>
<s> here e 2 so the order is 3 </s>
<s> this prime dataindex structure can continue to propagate itself as needed </s>
<s> however it takes much longer to add records that cause splitting so the addition versus updateonly figures are very important in assessing the efficiency of a btree </s>
<s> the additions to this btree have had no effect on the index entries on the lefthand side of the tree but have led to several changes to the righthand index entries </s>
<s> in order to examine this further let us look at another case </s>
<s> choice of index technique it is clear that the changes to the indexes caused by even a very few additions mean a great deal of reading and writing of data into the index areas on disk </s>
<s> this is a definite weakness of the btree </s>
<s> we therefore have a choice between index types that is affected by the use to which the file is put </s>
<s> in table 71 the three methods are compared scoring 1 for the best of the three 2 for the second and 3 for the worst </s>
<s> montgomery describes the nary tree method of indexing and compares it with hashing of keys discussed later in the chapter see p 230 </s>
<s> rathmann in a paper particularly concerned with optical disks compares the balanced tree method with the trie index technique as did severance </s>
<s> search the prime data track a single track search time </s>
<s> search the overflow area a variable search time </s>
<s> as this is timeconsuming particularly in the case of direct reference the file designer will aim to minimize it </s>
<s> ideally the file designer will aim to reduce the time taken to reference this index however when it exceeds a certain threshold value described earlier a master index which has one entry for each track of the cylinder index can be created to reduce the total search time as described above </s>
<s> if two or more higherlevel indexes exist each of them may be handled using a different one of the techniques described below aimed at reducing index search time depending on their size </s>
<s> in this case ibm software allows the user to store an exact submultiple of the index in main storage ie one half one third etc </s>
<s> when this applies the average seek time will be reduced to a half two thirds etc of average head movement time as the information will be available in main storage so saving a seek in an equivalent proportion of cases </s>
<s> if the file is held on a mass storage device location of higherlevel indexes on a disk will make a very significant contribution to reducing run times </s>
<s> c </s>
<s> the objective of these guidelines is to place the cylinder index on the file cylinder that is of lowest possible activity in such a position that the majority of head movements away from the index will be short </s>
<s> past practice has often been to allocate the cylinder index to a cylinder preceding or following the file area </s>
<s> this is never the best solution as pointed out above the centre of the file is the logical position if nothing is known about hit pattern </s>
<s> mullin suggested the use of hashing rather than indexing for the lowestlevel index </s>
<s> this limits the possible uses of such a technique to very active files that the user does not wish to reorganize frequently </s>
<s> if no additions are expected ii is not necessary to leave space for that purpose </s>
<s> although this allows fast retrieval of records it can lead to very low packing density of data because there may be many additions in one area and few in others </s>
<s> this is discussed in more detail below </s>
<s> however it means that references to added records will require movement of the access heads which wastes a great deal of time </s>
<s> variations in numbers of additions from one cylinder to another are to be expected </s>
<s> this method ensures that the file designer is not forced to provide very large embedded overflow areas on every cylinder when only a few cylinders require them </s>
<s> the number of policyholders can not grow and in this case the designer would not allocate any overflow areas </s>
<s> equal numbers of additions to each area this is a very unusual case </s>
<s> the designer must know that additions will be equal </s>
<s> this will allow rapid retrieval from the file as no extra head movements will be caused by additions </s>
<s> all additions concentrated in a few areas this can occur when for example recruitment campaigns for customers have taken place in a limited area or a competitor has gone out of business </s>
<s> if the times at which additions are expected can be predicted it may be wise to hold additions in an ancillary file until each burst of activity is over and then to reorganize the main file to include them </s>
<s> the poisson distribution used to predict synonym behaviour in direct files is the appropriate mathematical tool to use here note that if the number of embedded overflow areas is small the binomial distribution should be used instead </s>
<s> from equation 7 1 the percentage of embedded overflow areas that will have 0 1 n additions is given in table 72 </s>
<s> this difference is due to the fact that only onesixth of the records added to the six additions figure will overflow twosevenths of the seven additions threeeighths of the eight additions and so on </s>
<s> this has similar values to those given in table 64 </s>
<s> the derivations given here are due to the author and were published in the first edition but larson has also carried out similar work independently </s>
<s> each prime data cylinder contains ten tracks </s>
<s> one track in each cylinder is set aside as an embedded overflow area </s>
<s> the assumptions made are </s>
<s> additions of twenty twentyfour and thirtysix records have been made to cylinders five ten and fifteen </s>
<s> using equations 66 69 the figures obtained are shown in table 74 </s>
<s> thus the poisson distribution can safely be used instead of the binomial for files of this size </s>
<s> these three examples show the wide range of conditions that will have to be handled in providing far additions </s>
<s> the way in which additions to an indexed file are made can affect both sequential and direct access to the file </s>
<s> the principle is as shown in fig 710 </s>
<s> the ibm indexed sequential file management system isam works on the insertion principle </s>
<s> each cylinder index entry gives the address of the cylinder it refers to and the highest key on the cylinder </s>
<s> the form of balanced tree index used in isam operates as follows </s>
<s> the normal entry links the highest key at present on the prime data track with the address of the track </s>
<s> a program can check from this what records are at present logically on that track </s>
<s> the way in which additions occur and the changes to index and link entries are shown in fig 711 </s>
<s> this was the organization that preceded the indexed sequential file management system </s>
<s> if a record is stored in overflow a tag is placed in the home bucket pointing to the overflow storage position </s>
<s> however the extra speed of processing will repay the time taken to move these records if the file is frequently processed sequentially </s>
<s> random retrieval </s>
<s> for buckets holding two six and fourteen records </s>
<s> random processing random retrieval gave very variable results for icl files </s>
<s> random insertions were found to be variable in their effect on timing </s>
<s> average retrieval times fur icl files however increased from 40 ms to 150 ms due to the same number of additions </s>
<s> however it should be noted that additions to ibm files did not take a great deal longer than to icl files while random retrievals from ibm files were not markedly more rapid </s>
<s> for this reason the separate count key and data format is usually required ie </s>
<s> key equal </s>
<s> in principle a file could be arranged in descending order but most manufacturers software checks that the order is ascending and if it is not halts until the input order is corrected </s>
<s> searching for a record in blocked format is complicated by the fact that only one key can be placed in front of the block </s>
<s> if we were searching for this record a comparison with the key of the first block would be low and of the second high </s>
<s> in this case the whole block will have to be moved into main storage and the desired record will be retrieved by the use of a deblocking algorithm </s>
<s> there are obvious additional tasks to be carried out such as deblocking overflow calculations and efficient packing of the file storage areas that make this limitation understandable </s>
<s> however handling the whole track as a single block would prevent rapid transfer of individual records from the embedded overflow area during direct access reference which is the reason this method is often not adopted but see the section on software packages p 264 </s>
<s> if keys are greater than 155 bytes in length the track index will exceed one full track in extent and maximum length keys of 256 bytes will cause the cylinder index to take up as much as 28 per cent of the second track on the cylinder as well </s>
<s> the records or blocks of records take up more space because they are in the ckd format with separate keys </s>
<s> note that in some cases sequential files also use this format </s>
<s> the track index will take up part or all of the first track on each cylinder </s>
<s> if embedded or cylinder overflow areas are provided they will take up one or more tracks of every cylinder </s>
<s> the usual loss in packing density is again of the order of 05 per cent to 1 per cent but as with the highlevel indexes there will be a proportionately heavy overhead for small files if the software requires a complete cylinder to be used for independent overflow </s>
<s> this will depend on space being available to handle larger blocks in main storage it was considered in more detail in chapter 4 see p 75 </s>
<s> the best that can be achieved is 95 98 per cent packing if keys are small and no overflow is expected </s>
<s> as handling of the file is very different in these two cases we shall examine them separately </s>
<s> when the processing program issues a get macro the routine shown in fig 717 is initiated </s>
<s> the sequence has been simplified for convenience but it shows the essential stages in sequential retrieval </s>
<s> b </s>
<s> an increased number of data tracks each of which will require index entries and so will add to the time required for rotational delays described in 2 above </s>
<s> the impact of additions depends on the additions technique used </s>
<s> if a single record has been inserted the last record logically on the track will now be held in overflow </s>
<s> the duration of this wait may often lead to the overflow record being processed more rapidly than prime data track records because processing time will often be low enough to allow this record to be processed as soon as it is located </s>
<s> records on the prime data track as has been explained earlier may each cause a full revolution to be lost if they can not be processed during the time the interrecord gap is traversed </s>
<s> in this case an overflow chain of three records has been established from the prime track </s>
<s> if the minimum figure a loss of one revolution per overflow record is assumed as an average it will certainly not be an overestimate </s>
<s> experimental and simulation work carried out by montgomery and his coworkers has shown that the sequential retrieval time for records increases as more of the file is held in overflow </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> if skipsequential processing is correctly used whole areas of the file can be skipped producing an improvement in run time similar to that achieved by sectioning a sequential file on magnetic tape see chapter 5 for details p 112 </s>
<s> this will reduce the variability of timings due to chance variations in overlap and so make it possible to calculate run timings more accurately </s>
<s> the blocking of records in general has been dealt with in chapter 4 see pp 71 98 </s>
<s> this sequence occurs whenever a reference is made to the file and it is helpful to examine each stage of the process </s>
<s> if the file is small the cylinder index may be partly or entirely held in main storage as explained earlier in this chapter see p 228 </s>
<s> otherwise it should be stored on the most rapidly accessible device available </s>
<s> retrieval of records in files handled using linked overflow will not be so straightforward </s>
<s> depending on the software and the linkages provided it is probable that overflow records will have to be retrieved and checked as they are encountered </s>
<s> depending on the software further overflow records may take no additional time if it is not necessary to follow all chains or the average time per overflow record may be nr2 where there are n overflow records per track and every overflow chain has to be followed during a record search </s>
<s> overflow records held on a separate cylinder will require a head movement to the overflow cylinder </s>
<s> unlike its impact on sequential retrieval the result of blocking on direct retrieval is not marked </s>
<s> this is generally of the order of a millisecond or so at most </s>
<s> 126 cylinders with one or more active records in them </s>
<s> 74 inactive cylinders </s>
<s> in addition about seventyfour cylinders could be skipped so there would be around 126 × 10 ms required for head movements </s>
<s> these compare batching and sorting times with direct reference for a file that takes up the whole of a 2314 disk </s>
<s> the second consideration is that batching implies holding up the first enquiries to be received </s>
<s> as all of these may have default options it is important that the designer should make positive decisions about them and ensure that the file does reflect the design intended for it </s>
<s> although ease of use is important this approach to file design is not desirable unless the manufacturer s software also optimizes which is seldom possible </s>
<s> on occasions manufacturers software is not highly efficient for a given application and software houses have taken advantage of this to provide alternative packages </s>
<s> 1 </s>
<s> this allows a reasonable time for processing and results in fewer lost revolutions than is normally possible </s>
<s> however it doubles the minimum run time and so will not help in some cases </s>
<s> this provides more rapid access to established files and lessfrequent reorganizations </s>
<s> freshly reorganized files are identical in performance whether organized using psam or ibm s isam </s>
<s> examples like these make it appear that the performance of manufacturers software can always be bettered </s>
<s> coyle showed that it was possible to improve the speed of an isam file by more than four times by using the optimization options available in ibm s software </s>
<s> reference by relative record number fixedlength records only </s>
<s> additions to the file are catered for by the provision of distributed free space </s>
<s> when records are inserted the rbas of any following records will be increased as a result of their movement in the control interval </s>
<s> if there is insufficient room in the control area to handle all additions a control area split takes place under vsam control </s>
<s> the designer should look at the following factors </s>
<s> this means that movement from say a 3330 to a 3350 will require the definition of new control area sizes unless the number of control areas on a cylinder is already 2n on the 3330 </s>
<s> further details of vsam are available in ibm publications </s>
<s> although the user may imagine that any block size will be acceptable vsam only uses blocks of size 512b or 2048b where b can take any value in the range 1–16 this means that vsam will round up any intermediate value to the next available block size so wasting the difference between the two values </s>
<s> he also provides a very detailed description of the medium </s>
<s> in some cases however the design philosophy of another supplier will meet the user s needs more precisely </s>
<s> much of data processing involves retrieving records that refer to a given customer stock item or member of staff </s>
<s> in each of these cases a single key is all that is required to reference the record </s>
<s> there are no longer any single keys that uniquely define the document or documents wanted by the user </s>
<s> small files that demand multiplekey handling are usually stored on magnetic tape and processed sequentially </s>
<s> a specific request might require a count of all the grade 2 employees in the systems department </s>
<s> however it is not very useful for a bibliographic file in which there may be thousands of potential attributes for each record only a very few of which are nonzero </s>
<s> the resulting set of lists which are in effect indexes is shown in fig 82 for the same records in a data file that have already been shown in fig81 </s>
<s> a further example is shown in table 83 which is an inverted version of the data set out in tables 81 and 82 </s>
<s> a file in which all the attributes are inverted ie have indexes provided so that a direct search can be made on any attribute is known as fully inverted </s>
<s> a file in which only a number of selected attributes have indexes provided is known as partially inverted </s>
<s> the most usual arrangement is to have inverted lists of each descriptor with a list of the major record keys and addresses or if each record has a separate address addresses only for each of the records to which that descriptor applies </s>
<s> these files are indexed by the use of bdam basic direct access method and in a typical database of just over 2 gbytes which they found was the average size of those they examined the number of characters in the files comprising the database was as follows </s>
<s> dictionary 442 000 000 </s>
<s> each profile was made up of a combination of descriptors and boolean conditions and averaged twentysix distinct search terms </s>
<s> production of the complete sdi output took 12 minutes or just under 200 queries an hour </s>
<s> however in this case only the first reference to any descriptor appears in an index while all further linkages are made from record to record rather as in a chain of synonyms in a direct file </s>
<s> the arrangement of the same data that has been shown in figs 81 and 82 but now held as a multilist is shown in fig 83 </s>
<s> mcdonell provided a useful analysis of what is involved in addition deletion or modification of records so far as the maintenance and use of associative key lists is concerned he defined an associative key list as a list for each indexed key which joins together all the main file records containing that key </s>
<s> he also compared multilists with inverted files and showed that inverted files have an advantage when the indexes have to be altered frequently </s>
<s> a profile that provides far too many irrelevant references is of little use such lists normally find their way into a wastepaper basket because the user sees that they are full of irrelevant material and is not prepared to search through them hoping to find some relevant references </s>
<s> information retrieval systems include the concepts of relevance the proportion of retrieved material that is relevant and recall the proportion of relevant material that is retrieved </s>
<s> as mentioned earlier one possible answer is to use a bitpattern index of the sort shown in table 82 </s>
<s> a single bit represents each possible attribute </s>
<s> searching such an index is very rapid </s>
<s> a bitpattern index can extend the use of serial files when the number of attributes is limited but a breakeven point will occur somewhere between 20 000 and 100000 records depending on record size number of possible attributes and the complexity of boolean conditions required </s>
<s> this is reduced if there are many possible attributes because each attribute index list will tend to be shorter </s>
<s> the number of nested boolean conditions that can be handled by an inverted file is generally less than the number a serial file can handle </s>
<s> such a system has been discussed further by the author </s>
<s> addition of a new record will mean that a number of indexes will have to be updated one for each attribute possessed by the new record </s>
<s> if the average number of keys in the inverted file records is a then since the total number of terms in both the original and inverted files must be equal </s>
<s> thus the decision as to whether a file takes up more space in serial or inverted form depends on the ratio of the size of the key and the data items </s>
<s> note that this is of limited use as it implies that the data is held only in the index or in the main file </s>
<s> serial or inverted files specifically designed for the retrieval of records on the basis of the values of multiple keys are a useful tool for the file designer </s>

<s> but in fact holt cj s decision related to the escape of filth and his formulation of principle was limited to that and to cattletrespass it was not nearly so sweeping as the rule expressed in rylands v fletcher which was reached by methods extremely characteristic of judicial development of the law the creation of new law behind a screen of analogies drawn from existing law </s>
<s> the substantial advances which it made on the earlier law were two </s>
<s> in the direction of the persons for whose defaults in connection with such escape the occupier is vicariously responsible </s>
<s> as a result of this development the rule in rylands v fletcher is sometimes unavailable at times when it is most needed ie </s>

<s> widgery j s conclusion that the plaintiffs could not recover under the rule for economic injury alone seems perfectly correct at that time </s>
<s> the words for his own purposes will be discussed later </s>
<s> a licensee and brings on to it a dangerous thing is liable for its escape </s>

<s> there is no objective universal test of what is nonnatural </s>

<s> one can compare liability under the rule with the liability at common law for dangerous animals which was stricter </s>

<s> asserted that in the present time the defendant s liability in rylands v fletcher itself could simply have been placed on the defendant s failure of duty to take reasonable care and it seems a logical inference from this and from the judgment as a whole that the court of appeal considered the rule to have no useful function in modern times </s>

<s> there is a risk however that this inference may be drawn </s>
<s> the mere act of assembling data on a range of interventions gives greater prominence to the cost effectiveness data than does the reporting of the studies individually </s>

<s> it is important then to examine crystallinity in polymers and determine the factors which control the extent of crystallinity </s>

<s> this in turn restricts the number of disordered conformational states available to the chain due to the constraining influence of intramolecular interactions among chains in juxtaposition </s>
<s> however various other factors will tend to oppose crystallization chain entanglements will hinder the diffusion of chains into suitable orientations and if the temperature is above the melting temperature thermal motions will be sufficient to disrupt the potential nuclei before significant growth can take place </s>
<s> the first step in crystallite formation is the creation of a stable nucleus brought about by the ordering of chains in a parallel array stimulated by intramolecular forces followed by the stabilization of long range order by the secondary valence forces which aid the packing of molecules into a threedimensional ordered structure </s>
<s> this means that there will exist an optimum temperature of crystallization which depends largely on the interval t m to t g but also on the molar mass of the sample </s>
<s> in this state the chains are highly entangled and as sufficient time must be allowed for the chains to diffuse into the threedimensional order required for crystallite formation the crystalline perfection of the sample is affected by the thermal history </s>
<s> at low crystallization temperatures the nucleation density in the rubber melt is high segmental diffusion rates are low and small imperfect crystalline regions are formed </s>

<s> they are formed in the melt by diffusion of molecules or sections of molecules into close packed ordered arrays these then crystallize </s>
<s> the sizes of these crystallites are small relative to the length of a fully extended polymer chain but they are also found to be independent of the molar mass and rarely exceed 1 to 100 nm </s>
<s> thus a matrix of ordered regions with disordered interfacial areas is formed but unlike materials with small molar masses the ordered and disordered regions are not discrete entities and can not be separated by differential solution techniques unless the solvent causes selective degradation of the primary bonds in the amorphous regions </s>
<s> this model has now been virtually discarded in the light of more recent research which has revealed features incompatible with this picture </s>
<s> when a polymer is crystallized from the melt imperfect polycrystalline aggregations are formed in association with a substantial amorphous content </s>
<s> if these restrictions to free movement are reduced and a polymer is allowed to crystallize from a dilute solution it is possible to obtain welldefined single crystals </s>
<s> these crystals are usually very small but they have been detected for a range of polymers including polyesters polyamides polyethylene cellulose acetate and poly 4methyl pentene1 </s>

<s> there is also a remarkable constancy of lamellar thickness but this increases as the temperature increases </s>
<s> these have also been detected growing from a melt which suggests that lamellar growth can take place in the melt and may be a subunit of the spherulite </s>
<s> whereas crystallization from dilute solutions may result in the formation of single polymer crystals this perfection is not achieved when dealing with polymers cooled from the melt </s>

<s> a </s>
<s> measurements of the densities of several semicrystalline polymers points to the fact that a significant fraction of the chain units are in a non crystalline environment </s>

<s> the process is shown schematically in figure 116 and the resulting structure is a variation of the switchboard model </s>
<s> this means that large fibrous structures form near t m whereas greater numbers of small spherulites grow at lower temperatures </s>
<s> when the nucleation density is high the spherical symmetry tends to be lost as the spherulite edges impinge on their neighbours to form a mass such as shown in figure 117 </s>
<s> although the fibrils are arranged radially the molecular chains lie at right angles to the fibril axis </s>

<s> the amorphous or molten polymer is a conglomeration of badly packed interlacing chains and the extra empty space caused by this random molecular arrangement is called the free volume which essentially consists of all the holes in the matrix </s>
<s> heating will cause a polymer sample to expand thereby creating more room for movement of each kinetic unit and the application of a stress in a particular direction will encourage flow by segmental motion in the direction of the stress </s>
<s> the segmental transposition involving six carbon atoms is called crankshaft motion and is believed to require an activation energy of about 25 kj mol 1 </s>
<s> although it is thought that translation of a polymer chain proceeds by means of a series of segmental jumps involving short kinetic units which may each consist of between 15 and 30 chain atoms the complete movement of a chain can not remain unaffected by the surrounding chains </s>
<s> as independent chain mobility can not be discounted for these longer chains after the onset of entanglement a modified model is required to account for the ability of long chains to translate and diffuse through the polymer matrix ie the entanglement network must be considered as being transient </s>
<s> although for simplicity these network knots are regarded as a set of fixed obstacles round which the isolated chain under consideration must wriggle during translation in practice the network knots would also be in motion </s>
<s> two types of chain motion can be envisaged a conformational change taking place within the confines of the tube and more importantly reptation </s>
<s> if the tube is defined as having the same length as the unperturbed chain nl o where l o is the bond length under θ conditions corrected for short range interactions then the time required for the chain to reptate out of the tube is proportional to the square of the distance travelled ie </s>

<s> the increase in δh observed with temperature lowering can be equated with a rapid loss of free volume as t g is approached </s>
<s> this retractive action of linear uncrosslinked polymers can be observed if the time interval between extension and release is short but if the stress is maintained for some time then a relaxation process takes place allowing the tension to decay eventually to zero </s>

<s> as the temperature is raised a gradual loss in the elastic recovery is observed after each applied stress until a stage is reached when there is no recovery and the rubber remains in the deformed shape </s>
<s> although the glassrubber transition itself does not depend on polymer structure the temperature at which t g is observed depends largely on the chemical nature of the polymer chain and for most common synthetic polymers lies between 170 and 500 k it is quite obvious that t g is an important characteristic property of any polymer as it has an important bearing on the potential application of a polymer </s>
<s> on the other hand virtually no motion can be detected in atactic poly methyl methacrylate at 300 k but at 450 k the chains are in rapid motion </s>
<s> this means that at 300 k polyisoprene is likely to exhibit rubberlike behaviour and be useful as an elastomer whereas poly methyl methacrylate will be a glassy material </s>
<s> if the operating temperature was lowered to 100 k both polymers would be glasses </s>
<s> the phenomenon can be conveniently demonstrated using glucose pentaacetate gpa </s>
<s> a little perseverance with further rubbing and pulling will eventually result in the recrystallization of the rubbery phase which then crumbles to a powder </s>
<s> the glass transition is not a firstorder transition in the thermodynamic sense as no discontinuities are observed when the entropy or volume of the polymer are measured as a function of temperature </s>
<s> thus while the change in a physical property can be used to locate t g the transition bears many of the characteristics of a relaxation process and the precise value of t g can depend on the method used and the rate of the measurement </s>
<s> if we assume that in the transition region the restrictions to motion still present in the sample allow only a few segments to move in some time interval say 10 s then considerably fewer will have moved if the observation time is less than 10 s </s>
<s> this time dependence of segmental motion corresponds to the strongweak transformation of a hypothetical spring and results in the high damping which imparts the lifeless leathery consistency to the polymer in this region </s>
<s> a small sample of polymer suspended in this column provides a direct measure of the polymer density which can be measured easily as the temperature is varied </s>
<s> thus polar groups tend to encourage a higher t g than nonpolar groups of similar size as seen when comparing polypropylene poly vinyl chloride and polyacrylonitrile </s>
<s> if the temperature is decreased this free volume will contract and eventually reach a critical value when there is insufficient free space to allow large scale segmental motion to take place </s>
<s> below t g the free volume will remain essentially constant as the temperature decreases further since the chains have now been immobilized and frozen in position </s>
<s> the glass transition can then be visualized as the onset of coordinated segmental motion made possible by an increase of the holes in the polymer matrix to a size sufficient to allow this type of motion to occur </s>
<s> simha and boyer observed that a general empirical relationship exists between the t g and the difference in expansion coefficients of the liquid and glass states </s>
<s> this is an empirical equation but it can also be derived from free volume considerations by starting with a description of the viscosity of the system </s>

<s> this aspect is considered in the gd theory by defining a new transition temperature t 2 at which the configurational entropy of the system is zero </s>
<s> on this basis the experimentally detectable t g is a time dependent relaxation process and the observed value is a function of the time scale of the measuring technique </s>
<s> the fractions of unoccupied and occupied sites are f o and f x respectively while s o is a function of f o f x and z </s>
<s> in spite of these limitations various aspects of the behaviour of copolymers plasticized polymers and the chain length dependence of t g can be predicted in a reasonably satisfactory manner </s>
<s> while the kinetic approach embodied in the wlf equation and the equilibrium treatment of the gd theory have both been successful in their way the onesided aspect of each probably masks the fact that they are not entirely incompatible with one another </s>

<s> presenting evidence in support of and against various positions which might be taken up with regard to the issue </s>
<s> reaching a conclusion consistent with the evidence and arguments you have presented </s>
<s> alongside the development of these skills the subject matter of your essays offers an additional benefit </s>
<s> in most cases when you write an essay you largely decide for yourself what to write about </s>
<s> to begin with then we need to identify the different kinds of focus and modes of argument that are possible so that you can gain a general sense of the elements which are combined together in an essay in literary studies </s>
<s> focus i authors examples the life and works of edgar allen poe women romantic poets </s>
<s> focus v theoretical issues relating to literary study examples comparison of poststructuralist approaches to the lyric poem the mental processes involved in construing a metaphor why it is possible to have manipulations of pointofview in narrative </s>

<s> example an essay showing that the linguistic theory of conversational analysis can help us understand how characters in conrad s novels control each other through the ways they interact in speech </s>
<s> if you have to devise your own topic you can do so by selecting and combining from the lists of different approaches above </s>
<s> the idiom is worth learning to understand in order to develop a sense of how you should respond to the often hidden questions inside an examination or coursework question </s>
<s> in this book we will look at the kinds of things you have to do to respond to each type of question </s>
<s> give examples or the related with reference to not less than two texts invites you to present concrete illustration which should generally include quotation and paraphrase of episodes or incidents from the text to support the points you make </s>
<s> we can accordingly make a general summary of the tasks you are being invited to perform in response to essay questions </s>
<s> it is helpful to bear in mind these recurrent instruction words discuss assess etc as you contemplate in an examination a list of questions that you have to choose between </s>
<s> so in this section we look more closely at how whole exam questions illustrated here from recent university of london examination papers are structured before considering some more general examroom strategies </s>
<s> diction rhythm rhyme and syntax may be of special interest </s>
<s> bakhtin s dialogic reading can defuse scepticism about the possibility of meaning </s>
<s> and be especially careful with formulations of the kind illustrated in the examples below do not be misled by a direct interrogative the answer is never just a long version of yes or no </s>
<s> psychoanalytic criticism can merge with other kinds of reading without supplanting them it can underpin without undermining </s>
<s> have you found this to be so </s>
<s> is warmheartedness an adequate epitome of dickens s social theory </s>
<s> c other specific types of question in what ways can elizabeth barrett browning s poetry be regarded as subversive </s>
<s> with this type of question be careful not just to make a list </s>
<s> you could begin your essay by acknowledging this and continue to work with the definitions throughout the essay relating the different definitions together in the conclusion </s>
<s> words like some in examination questions are there to show that examiners do nt think exhaustive answers are possible any response will be partial </s>
<s> but this does not mean you should limit yourself in how many expressive purposes you discuss </s>
<s> write on milton s humour </s>
<s> the special difficulty here is that since relatively little essay structure is signalled by the question itself in your first paragraph you will have to make very clear to your examiner what shape you are imposing on your discussion </s>
<s> note that your essay in this case is not centrally concerned with coleridge in fact you will almost certainly do less well if you write about coleridge than if you discuss a different author </s>
<s> where a question seems broad or general explain how you are interpreting it in order to make it more manageable </s>
<s> keep your paper tidy for example by deleting all notes at the end but do nt use correcting fluid to remove errors it is a sure way of telling your examiner that you want to focus on appearance at the expense of content </s>
<s> by way of general preparation it can also be useful to prepare material in component prefabricated packages before the exam itself </s>
<s> begin by jotting down what you think they are plus any thoughts this triggers off </s>
<s> this stage resembles planning your essay outline and could give you your necessary paragraph headings particularly since an exam essay gives room for only a few paragraphs </s>
<s> establish in your mind the scope and boundaries of the material which will be relevant bearing in mind the formulation of the question choose two plays by shakespeare etc </s>
<s> undervalued achievement the contribution of ralph ellison s invisible man to the development of africanamerican fiction </s>
<s> or to the question the contribution made by ralph ellison s invisible man to the development of africanamerican fiction is undervalued </s>
<s> if in doubt keep it simple </s>
<s> as you write the essay you may find that the focus shifts with the result that you end up rejecting the original title and finding a more suitable one </s>
<s> more generally it illustrates how everything you do even your choice of a title is a part of your thinking about your essay and contributes to its development </s>
<s> but originality presents a difficult problem because unless you are doing advanced research you are unlikely to be in a position to advance new facts or radically new interpretations or even to have a wide enough knowledge of what other people have written to be sure that you are not duplicating it </s>
<s> this is especially likely to be the case with short essays and exam answers where you clearly can not be expected to be original in the sense in which a researcher or expert in the field might be expected to be </s>
<s> this is inappropriate for a number of reasons first because you are primarily assessed on relative quality good for a secondyear dissertation rather than absolute quality second because there is no point in simply rewriting someone else s ideas you might as well submit their original book or article instead and third because it underestimates the possibilities of disagreement adaptation and development which exist in all areas of the field </s>
<s> this is not just a matter of showing that you are not stealing or plagiarising other people s work </s>
<s> this means making decisions very early on about the contents of the whole essay eg by writing an initial synopsis </s>
<s> an estimate is enough </s>
<s> if you have a detailed outline of the structure and proportions then if the essay becomes too long you can work out more precisely where deletions need to be made take out redundant or duplicated examples cut lists shorter reduce alternative words offered as glosses etc </s>
<s> in this section we look at some ways of doing this and more generally of getting from the planning stage to the writing stage </s>
<s> one productive starting point is to break the illusion that writing is a gestation process of waiting for inspiration until the essay forms itself fullyfledged in your mind and just needs to be written down </s>
<s> break down the process of constructing an essay into easy small steps </s>
<s> the best answer you can give in these circumstances should provide the shape for your synopsis </s>
<s> as we suggest in more detail in chapters 2 and 3 you will be able to find materials more easily and see the best arrangement for them when you have formed a sense of what you are looking for </s>
<s> most fields are too large to research convincingly unless you go into them with at least a provisional focus </s>
<s> clearly you need to use the time you have available to consolidate what is going to be in the foreground what is central to your essay rather than in mugging up materials which at best can only ever form marginal elements of the final piece of work </s>
<s> just as you can prepare for an exam by looking at old exam questions so you can prepare to write a dissertation by looking at previous examples which have been submitted and accepted by your institution </s>
<s> the structure of your project needs to be visible almost at a glance </s>
<s> is there a distinction between the way men use irony and women use irony in emma etc </s>
<s> a collection of questions will not necessarily give you a coherent focus for your essay so you need to encapsulate as many as you can in a single basic question </s>
<s> answering the first part involves classifying characters into types so it is useful to think of all types which might be relevant in answering the question male versus female old versus young poor versus rich and as many more as you can think of </s>
<s> each of these answers raises further questions </s>
<s> this is exactly how you can build your essay as a sequence of questions and answers </s>
<s> your essay needs to provide evidence or reasons for your point of view </s>
<s> again indicate this as precisely as possible </s>
<s> summary in this chapter we have suggested that how you present the evidence and arguments which make up your case about a problem or issue is at least as important in literary studies as the particular viewpoint you adopt and counts as originality </s>
<s> exam and essay questions come in a range of identifiable idioms and there are established conventions for responding to them </s>
<s> learn the language of examination and set essay questions so that you know how to speak suitable answers pp 15 17 </s>
<s> 1 select a novel you have just read </s>
<s> make a series of paragraph or section headings that you could use in a onehour exam answer </s>
<s> 3 invent a title in two parts as in section 16 making sure that it indicates your attitude to the subject matter </s>
<s> for example in writing an essay on some aspect of emily dickinson s poetry you might use possibly in order of likelihood </s>
<s> a some poems by emily dickinson which you analyse b a bibliography list of books and articles to find out what has been written by and on this poet c one or more critical articles on emily dickinson d a biography of the writer e a dictionary of symbolism to look up some of the symbols she uses f a concordance to the works of emily dickinson this is a list of all the words she used and where she used them </s>
<s> each of these sources provides new information that will enrich the ideas you start out with and the materials you explore will also provide a springboard into completely new ideas that you are unlikely to have simply by contemplating the poems themselves </s>
<s> we can begin by returning to the question of defining your essay topic </s>
<s> other choices include should you pick wellknown texts or littleknown texts </s>
<s> they are not simply background materials for your preparation but guide what sort of essay will result </s>
<s> in other cases it is shaped by personal preference eg you already feel that you have something specific to say on a particular work </s>
<s> once you have chosen your texts or had them chosen for you you need to decide how to focus on them </s>
<s> no matter how familiar with literary works you become you can not focus equally on all parts of a text particularly a long text such as a novel so you need to decide which parts of it are most worth reading closely and writing about </s>
<s> this varies from novel to novel but as a general guideline it is usually worth paying particular attention to the beginning and ending where structural aspects of the novel are often signalled most clearly </s>
<s> even the first printed edition of a text may have been altered by an editor printer or typesetter </s>

<s> modern critical editions sometimes also make changes which go against authorial intentions keynes s oxford edition of blake s poems for example changes blake s invented punctuation system to make it fit with standard rules of punctuation </s>
<s> it is useful to distinguish between an original edition a popular reprint and a critical edition </s>
<s> a critical edition has a named editor who tries to make the text the best possible version and will usually include footnotes or appendices explaining decisions taken about words in the text </s>
<s> older texts are also reprinted in popular editions popular for ordinary people generally for nonacademic purposes though in practice often the editions used on courses </s>
<s> but you should avoid illustrated coffee table versions or simplified rewritten editions of a text intended for efl students or children </s>
<s> much of what you will need for your study will be in the literary texts you have chosen especially if you are reading annotated critical editions </s>
<s> textbooks may of course also include original ideas so the distinction becomes blurred especially where a textbook does nt tell you where it is offering contentious interpretations </s>
<s> a formulation of an original idea eg in a monograph is a primary source of that idea its repetition or paraphrase in a textbook or in another monograph is a secondary source of it </s>
<s> because words change in meaning it can be particularly useful to use a historical dictionary such as the oxford english dictionary oed existing as a multivolume set or photographically reduced or on cdrom </s>
<s> if you are writing about a twentiethcentury author and you want ideas about the author or what to say about her or him you can use the massive reference work published by gale contemporary authors which lists biographical and bibliographical information together with other relevant comments and contemporary literary criticism which is described as excerpts from criticism of the works of today s novelists poets playwrights and other creative writers </s>

<s> once the film credits are over you have no permanent record </s>
<s> if you are writing about eliot s poem the waste land published in 1922 for example you might consider it relevant to know about other events of that year or the years when it was being written and so you could look up 1922 in the index to the london newspaper the times the poem is set partly in london and was published there </s>
<s> in these indexes you will find information about countries types of event eg crimes about the arts eg reviews and about the subjects and terms of reference of contemporaneous public debate </s>
<s> as well as indexes for many newspapers there are compendia such as keesings contemporary archives factual reports on current affairs throughout the world based on information abstracted from press broadcasting official and other sources published from 1931 onwards </s>

<s> the original but still available brewer s dictionary of phrase and fable is an example of a nineteenthcentury collection of somewhat idiosyncratically chosen historical mythical and literary information it is useful partly because of its eccentricity in that it contains information you may not find elsewhere </s>
<s> one way of acquiring such ideas of course is to look on the shelves of a library or bookshop or in a publisher s or library catalogue where you will find books gathered by subject and by author </s>
<s> make yourself open to chance often you will find things by accident while looking for something else or when just browsing aimlessly </s>
<s> you may also like to look in anthologies </s>
<s> if your library has a computerised catalogue you may be able to get a list of all the books held on a particular subject matter </s>
<s> notice that modern language in titles usually means literature as well as language and looking in bibliographies for ideas about what to read is called a literature search literature in this sense means the collection of what has been written </s>
<s> a third approach is to look at abstracts </s>
<s> another way of finding useful or appropriate things to read is to look at library catalogues which have been published as books </s>
<s> in college and university libraries you will often find catalogues for other collections </s>
<s> if you have a book or article in your hands check the contents page and preface or introduction these will give you a sketch of the book s scope and argument </s>
<s> it is also useful to look at the bibliography or index to see what it includes and what it misses out </s>
<s> in some cases however the elusive book which you need may in fact be hidden in your own library </s>
<s> once you have it in your hands there are a number of different ways of using it </s>
<s> because you will often have more to read than you have time for you need to develop ways of reading more quickly and efficiently </s>
<s> both of these reading techniques are examples of how reading is a selective activity </s>
<s> do they provide facts or views you can use </s>
<s> your reading will be useful only if you remember it and can do something with it </s>
<s> there are various ways of storing the results of your reading </s>
<s> they may also be a record of your developing ideas </s>
<s> or a card which contains only notes from monk s book the sublime a study of critical theories in eighteenthcentury england </s>
<s> you also have to be able to have the computer with you when you take the notes which is not always easy to arrange </s>
<s> in some cases it can be difficult or even impossible to find texts again for example if the text is a lecture or a television programme but you should still keep details of them as fully as possible so that your reader knows exactly where ideas or words come from </s>

<s> put a colon between the title and the subtitle even if there is nt one in the original </s>
<s> e if the text is an article in a journal or a chapter in an edited book or anthology keep details about the collection in which you found it for a journal article note the volume and issue number and the page numbers on which the article appears </s>

<s> in the right column note down all the points which would be relevant to or useful in your essay in particular </s>
<s> compare the two columns </s>
<s> when you write an essay what you typically do put at its simplest is gather material and then arrange it </s>
<s> in writing on a given passage often in response to a general question in a practical criticism or commentary and analysis course it can be helpful in considering what to say to organise your answer around the following questions a who is the speaker </s>
<s> e how would you describe the style of the passage </s>
<s> which particular words or phrases indicate this most clearly </s>
<s> g how far is the passage supposed to be realistic </s>
<s> there are many aspects of any given passage to describe besides these </s>
<s> in most cases the connection is one between observation of structure and response your interpretation </s>
<s> without responses or interpretation on the other hand observations are unworkedout descriptions </s>
<s> for example a classificatory system imposed on the material divides it into abstract categories eg into a chronology on the basis of definable periods or into a typology or system of sorting on the basis of formal likeness and difference </s>
<s> any classificatory system you use to organise your essay has to be explained of course eg divisions between historical periods need to be discussed and justified </s>
<s> but introducing a classificatory element almost always radically improves a descriptive essay </s>
<s> if you are writing on this topic you can work out a list of different sorts of tragedy </s>
<s> or you can classify the novel according to where it was written west of scotland and think about it as an example of writing from this locality </s>
<s> as an illustration of this consider the following project an essay on metaphors used in advertisements this imaginary project might begin with an analysis of the metaphors used in ten advertisements </s>
<s> we decide to look for a connection between types of advert and types of metaphor </s>
<s> we then also classify the metaphors into types metaphors where an object is treated like a part of a body and other types of metaphor </s>
<s> if the answer is yes then we have learnt something a correlation which may turn out to be an instance of causation and in writing it down we will be saying something new </s>
<s> sometimes you can organise your essay around an already existing critical controversy eg between established schools of thought such as new criticism and poststructuralism </s>
<s> in order to accentuate the general significance of your arguments it can be helpful to generalise from individuals to movements or types of thought you discuss leavisism for instance rather than leavis s work in particular </s>
<s> in presenting ideas of the school or movement however you will need to be careful about distinguishing your own words from your paraphrase of the positions you are representing </s>
<s> as in this simple mental experiment of the narrative ending most experiments in literary studies involve taking related versions of a text and seeing what effects on a reader the differences between them have </s>
<s> you are likely to be looking for the relation between the variable part of the text called the independent variable because you are manipulating it by making changes and the variation in the response of the reader called the dependent variable because it depends on the variation or changes made to the text </s>
<s> even if you have no interest in the play henry v itself the comparison helps you to learn about eighteenthcentury attitudes by providing information and insights you can then use to look at eighteenthcentury drama generally </s>
<s> you might compare for instance a real letter from 1740 with one of the letters in richardson s novel pamela published 1740 and made up of a sequence of imitation letters </s>
<s> another keyword might be islamic </s>
<s> our revised version is the result of the following organisational changes a we put career as a london playwright into a larger section called biographical details because there are other relevant biographical points we will want to make </s>
<s> similarly we have made a group of themes </s>
<s> at many points in your essay you will just want to propose or say something so many of your sentences will be assertions </s>
<s> when you make an assertion what you are doing is telling your reader something you think is true </s>
<s> justification could be given for this assertion by describing dickens s view of the london working classes then describing the view of one or more modern historians then showing that the two views are significantly different to the extent that dickens s could be called incorrect </s>
<s> nevertheless there are no fixed rules about justifying arguments in literary studies </s>
<s> the conventions about what counts as a convincing argument vary with time and place </s>
<s> this is unavoidable and occurs all the time as you speak or write </s>
<s> we have seen one kind </s>
<s> a phrase like the second novel dickens produced is not itself a statement of fact but can be rewritten as a sentence to show its presupposition dickens produced a second novel </s>
<s> a similar mechanism works in what is kristeva s position on genderpositioning in this article </s>
<s> presuppositions are sometimes embedded with particular verbs including factive verbs like regret or know which presuppose that what is regretted or known is a fact </s>
<s> this presupposes that the main character believed in god </s>
<s> this presupposes that victorian writers tried to persuade us that some connectives such as although since and because also conceal presuppositions because dickens was a social reformer he focused in his work on poverty </s>
<s> it is also possible to put presuppositions into a sentence by just rearranging the parts as in the following example called a cleft based on senecan influence brought blood to renaissance tragedy it was senecan influence which brought blood to renaissance tragedy </s>
<s> it is worth checking your essay to make sure that you are not presupposing things which you do nt believe are true and that you are nt hiding anything in a presupposition which needs to be made explicit and justified </s>
<s> there is a literary achievement of the renaissance </s>
<s> there was a renaissance </s>
<s> this in turn gives your reader a sense of what sort of debate or discussion you see yourself as being engaged in and it is this alongside whatever concrete arguments you make on a given topic which shapes a reader s or examiner s general response to what you write </s>
<s> in this chapter so far we have focused on specificities in your argument the presuppositions in your sentences the specific things you can say about particular texts the setting of something in its context and so on </s>
<s> however specific observations always needs to be related to general claims or generalisations without which the specific can just seem trivial and random </s>
<s> so generalisation is important as a way of pulling you out of just describing the details of your individual experience as a reader enabling you to make statements which are likely to be of interest to others about patterns or structures in the way literary texts work </s>
<s> in practice you might for instance a broaden your essay s conclusions so that they could in principle be applied to other books or an author s work as a whole </s>
<s> example if you have a paragraph on irony in conrad s heart of darkness a paragraph on characterisation and a paragraph on narrative closure you could try to link them together by talking more generally about the abstract relationship between irony characterisation and narrative closure </s>
<s> two different problematic situations are likely to arise as you present your argument </s>
<s> the second situation is that you feel there is a risk of overstating the line of argument you are pursuing </s>
<s> consider first the effect of adding of course to a sentence </s>
<s> george eliot of course believed that </s>
<s> if we already know what we are being told as of course implies then the question immediately arises why we are being told again </s>
<s> as in most other areas of essay writing there is no fixed rule governing use of of course </s>
<s> other useful words here are evidently rather somewhat generally on the whole can appear to and arguably </s>
<s> summary in this chapter we have described the different forms an argument in literary studies can take </s>
<s> by signalling clearly the significance of the ideas you present and the attitude you are adopting towards them you enable your reader to follow the essay as a coherent and developing debate in which the generalisations and conclusions you finally draw will seem reasonable and justified </s>
<s> remember writing an essay means arguing a case see p 51 </s>
<s> organising an essay around a preexisting sequence such as historical order is straightforward but often not the most interesting or useful option see p 54 </s>
<s> think through the implications of inserting words like of course and arguably see pp 67 8 </s>
<s> 2 choose a poem the same one as in exercise 1 if you like and put the title after the first stanza so that it is in the middle of the poem instead of at the beginning </s>
<s> 3 in 1902 the first major science fiction film was made in france the twentyoneminute silent a trip to the moon by george méliès </s>
<s> look up 1902 in an annals or book of dates and events and make a list of ten other events or publications historical artistic literary philosophical musical scientific etc from 1902 </s>
<s> argumentative if so what are the main conflicting positions or theories you are evaluating </s>
<s> now reconsider the question you were answering </s>
<s> is it possible to identify the considerations which lead you to believe that these presuppositions do nt need justification or explanation in your essay </s>
<s> in the next three chapters we look more closely at the texture of essaywriting </s>
<s> for example a birthday card greeting is written in a different register from a legal contract in that it uses a different vocabulary uses a different layout on the page uses rhyme etc </s>
<s> rather the convention is that certain registers are used consistently in essays </s>
<s> so it is helpful to understand what such registers consist of and how you create them </s>
<s> but it is important to stress from the outset that each norm can and should be overruled for specific purposes of your own </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so such styles will probably be ineffective or even counterproductive and they are also potentially embarrassing to the writer </s>
<s> academic register is formal but not as formal as legal or religious language with their archaic vocabularies again the underlying idea that your writing should be clear means that your style can not be too obscure </s>
<s> what a bad poem this is </s>
<s> textbooks have a register of their own and do not provide a suitable model for imitating in your essaywriting </s>
<s> in part academic register is a convention you learn to adopt so that your essays sound right </s>
<s> at least some of the elements however have a more important function </s>
<s> a difficult question remains unanswered by the notion of standardisation however the status of class ethnic or regional variation </s>
<s> putting it in an academic essay would certainly be unexpected but it might be possible to claim that it is a regionalclass standard written form </s>
<s> a written sentence on the other hand can more easily be hypotactic which means that it can have complex relations between its parts one inside another rather than just one after another </s>
<s> academic register is usually characterised partly by avoiding the features of spoken register </s>
<s> does this therefore mean that you should avoid short sentences </s>
<s> certainly there are some extremely short sentences eg yes </s>
<s> on the whole though relatively short sentences offer the advantage of helping you to keep your writing clear and understandable </s>
<s> if short and simple sentences dominate your writing however it may become monotonous </s>
<s> so you should entertain the possibility of communicating more complex thoughts by building more complex sentences </s>
<s> to bring about greater stylistic variation and interest the extract could be rewritten by combining sentences 1 and 2 and sentences 3 and 4 as a way of reflecting the development of their heroines both brontë and hardy present them within an organic structure </s>
<s> we could for example replace the full stop between the two sentences of our rewritten version with a semicolon so turning the original four short sentences into a single more complex sentence </s>
<s> this is no doubt used partly to avoid repeating marriage which is the title of the poem and so has already been used more than once </s>
<s> the effort to produce a technical or elevated alternative to length results here only in a comic effect a sort of malapropism or effect of trying to use words which are imperfectly understood </s>
<s> aspects of your chosen register signal your attitude towards your reader as well as sometimes towards the writers you are discussing </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> eliot uses at times a simplistic traditional form which incorporates elements of modernism ie the subject matter providing a quirky pattern common in some poems </s>
<s> in this way you reduce the impression that you are judging writing by a known literary writer as unsuccessful in direct comparison with your own capabilities or achievements </s>
<s> the vocabulary of evaluation especially praise is so heavily used in speech including in hyperbole or exaggerated forms that it can take on surprising effects in more formal written contexts </s>
<s> consider the following apparently straightforward sentence there are many concerns that make the book very interesting indeed </s>
<s> the second stanza subtly introduces the theme of </s>
<s> but you need to be careful in using them because they can introduce meanings you may not intend </s>
<s> running through the history of literary criticism is a series of debates over the connection or contrast between literature and philosophy and between the aesthetic imagination and science </s>
<s> then again there are other genres which try to avoid using any technical terms at all in the belief that literary studies should be accessible to all without special training in a professional vocabulary </s>
<s> as you will certainly need to use technical terms at some point in your writing you inevitably have to face the two main problems they present </s>
<s> you can solve this problem by putting such terms in inverted commas when you first introduce them </s>
<s> as long as they do not become too obtrusive such glosses serve to embed technical terms effectively even within a register which is in other respects informal or even impressionistic </s>
<s> nevertheless one problem with using glosses is that you need to decide which terms to gloss some terms will have conventional meanings in the genre you are writing in while other terms like synonymous in the above quotation will be common in nontechnical discourse </s>
<s> you can get help with deciding whether to explain a term by consulting a dictionary of critical terms to see which terms other people the dictionary s editor for example have decided merit explanation </s>
<s> however this is with halfrhymes which sometimes only vaguely go together for example shine and join </s>
<s> this type of uncomfortable rhyming creates the impression of the author having difficulty weaving his or her emotions </s>
<s> without the case for these assumptions being established the formal description merely signals that the writer knows roughly what a sonnet is </s>
<s> another contrasting function served by inverted commas besides direct quotation which is discussed below chapter 5 pp 105 7 is that of distancing you from an expression </s>
<s> in some cases consulting a thesaurus will offer an alternative </s>
<s> remember that scare quotes themselves are simply disclaimers this is nt my word so do nt blame me for its implications they do not solve or even identify the problems that the word presents </s>
<s> philosophically it could be argued in any case that most or all words present analogous difficulties and need to be put in scare quotes the topic of this essay is the issue of the authors intentions etc </s>
<s> in the following passive sentence the writer does not tell us who did the associating newspapers literary critics the general public everyone </s>
<s> the beginning of a sentence generally introduces what it is about often an item of given information ie something which has already been mentioned or has been directly implied </s>
<s> rhetorical questions work then when they are answered in what follows and so long as they are not overused </s>
<s> in this respect too much use of i especially i think i noticed i much prefer etc prevents the essay from attaining that level of generalisation </s>
<s> personification of your essay itself as an agent rewrite in this essay i explain how as this essay explains how </s>
<s> this recommendation to avoid one and we has a justification besides traditional reservations about personal intrusion </s>
<s> both one and we produce the effect of generalised response one combines the personal dimension of i with the general characteristic of anyone ie the writer serves as a norm or representative of everyone else and we at least in its inclusive use as readers we feel in this passage rather than as authorial we the author suggests generalised readerreaction </s>
<s> so you may want to modify such formulations along the lines a reader is likely to feel at this point or many readers may respond by or possibly better by tackling the issue of heterogeneous readerresponses more directly </s>
<s> the precise degree to which you decide to use techniques for avoiding i and we will depend on the overall register you are trying to produce </s>
<s> i should have thought that </s>
<s> yet secondperson pronouns are not generally accepted in academic writing a characteristic of the idiom linked to the idea of criticism having less a given particular reader than of an unspecified general readership </s>
<s> consider this sentence the reader will find his expectations satisfied </s>
<s> while this used to be common practice it is now widely considered sexist such usage represents the masculine as the norm and so marginalises women </s>
<s> in the case of the link between reader he the male as norm terminology creates the impression that educated discussion of literature takes place only among men even though literary study was established in britain in the nineteenth century as a subject largely for women and now has a significant majority of women involved in it </s>
<s> such usage also reinforces the common but mistaken idea that authors are normally men rather than women an idea which is probably only true of the canon of writers selected for study generally by male critics not of writing as a whole </s>
<s> or you can use she and herhis to replace he andor she </s>
<s> similarly you should avoid terms such as poetess actress lady novelist etc which are all asymmetrical with the malecounterpart term poet actor etc </s>
<s> but you can not simply opt out of the issue altogether no matter who you are whatever choice you make in this area will have a meaning and give a signal </s>
<s> it also signals in passing your awareness of issues of gender race and other questions of social distinction which arise in literary study this awareness should then extend into your choice of particular texts and authors to study and into the comments and analysis of images of gender sexuality and difference you develop </s>
<s> use a mixture of short sentences and longer more complex sentences see pp 76 7 </s>
<s> use the same register throughout an essay see pp 77 8 </s>
<s> use technical terms only when you are going to say something with them which you could nt say without them see pp 81 2 </s>
<s> do nt copy the style of a literary text you are writing about see p 85 </s>
<s> take the paragraph on p 73 beginning on the whole underline all parts of it which might be considered not to belong to standard academic register and explain why and rewrite the paragraph in academic register </s>
<s> when you do this bear in mind the need to avoid bias in the use of pronouns section 413 </s>
<s> 3 rewrite the extract on p 78 beginning moore states so that its register is consistent and neither too high nor too low for academic writing </s>
<s> both acts are morally wrong edward should not have abused his divine right and curried favour by dishing out peerages </s>
<s> so at the nub of marlowe s play is the morality of deposition and the morality of a married king shunning his wife in favour of a homosexual lover </s>
<s> the essay begins by stating its main point that the title focuses attention on a multifunctional symbol within the story </s>
<s> but to do this the writer simply repeats the wording of the question </s>
<s> just repeating the question tells your examiner nothing about what you know and takes up time and space </s>
<s> reworking the question into a related generalisation on the other hand shows that you understand something of the complexities it contains </s>
<s> similarly as you rework the question into your first sentence you can begin to show that key terms in the question are problematic or vague or you can suggest what kind of evidence you will draw on to discuss the question </s>
<s> quoting burrow </s>
<s> and since the larger concept of genre within which they play a part is also problematic my discussion of the two terms will be prefaced by a more general discussion of genre </s>
<s> in its first few lines the rewritten passage now offers reasons for organising the essay in the way that has been chosen and so connects the answer more directly with the question </s>
<s> slightly different problems arise in our next example though again they are related to the relationship between the various topics being introduced the sonnet on the death of mr richard west contains many halfrhymes and can be split into two groups the octave and the sestet </s>
<s> in this passage three topics are introduced the sonnet s form its tone and its mode of address </s>
<s> but no link is suggested between them and it is not yet clear what the point of the essay is </s>
<s> in this revised version the individual observations are collected together under a common denominator labelled formal qualities and are linked to the claimed mood of the poem </s>
<s> but you need to remember that the menu should not be too large some essays become very frontheavy with preliminaries and you should ensure that items you have placed on the menu are actually served up to the reader later </s>
<s> organising your essay in advance changes the process of writing a first paragraph </s>
<s> advance planning makes it possible to write the essay in sections and put the sections together only at the end with the result that you do not have to write the sections in the order in which they will finally appear </s>
<s> in a long dissertation it might be justified as a way of helping your reader remember your starting point in a short essay however it is redundant and simply shows that you do nt know how to finish </s>
<s> each of the questions above is worth exploring especially because final paragraphs and sentences often fall into one of a number of largely unsatisfactory idioms each with its own way of dealing with ending less as an opportunity than as an escape </s>
<s> your essay is an argument and you should present different sides of that argument </s>
<s> consider this final sentence from an essay on the element of satire in two restoration dramatists both playwrights succeed in mixing description with analysis which is conveyed in entertaining prose </s>
<s> when you write an essay you have both the opportunity and the responsibility to state your own views in your own words </s>
<s> we talk later in this chapter about the use of other people s words making the point that one problem with other people s words is that they usually make more sense where they come from than where you put them in your essay </s>
<s> your outline see above chapter 1 pp 22 4 and chapter 3 pp 59 61 will indicate what needs to go into each part of your essay and enables you to write the different parts in any order you wish </s>
<s> this does not need to be done explicitly eg through devices such as in the last paragraph i have argued but can be achieved by phrases like this x or the idea that x where x is a term or phrase used in the previous paragraph </s>
<s> if you do use subsections you can number them 1 11 12 etc or give them short titles which indicate what they contain </s>
<s> one way of doing this is to structure your paragraph as first sentence topic sentence makes the main claim of the paragraph and tries also to link the paragraph with what came before subsequent sentences justify or illustrate the claim </s>
<s> final sentence sums up the paragraph and perhaps tries also to link the paragraph with what will come next </s>
<s> eliot s concern with decay and desperation which also provides a source for the name of the motif the waste land motif </s>
<s> finally in sentence 4 the parallel between eliot and fitzgerald is drawn explicitly and the way the motif works in the novel is explained so completing a miniature demonstration of what was promised in the paragraph s opening topic sentence </s>
<s> too few paragraphs can make the essay difficult to follow both visually and conceptually and suggests that it may not have an underlying argument structure at all </s>
<s> most sentences in written prose are explicitly linked with the sentence which precedes them producing an overall effect of cohesion </s>
<s> 5 so the dream vision must have had a tremendous impact on his perception of the world </s>
<s> secondly many of the markers signal specific often logical relationships between one sentence and another as so does in the passage above such markers control the progression of your writing from idea to idea </s>
<s> however shakespeare wrote othello </s>
<s> notice here the slight oddity of however </s>
<s> rather however creates a contrast concerning the idea of a writer foreseeing the effect on later audiences something which pulls the essay in a different direction from one which might create the expectation that othello would be introduced </s>
<s> alongside the sorts of connective listed above other kinds of link can also be useful </s>
<s> sometimes a disjunct can be used a word or phrase which tells your reader what your attitude or degree of commitment is towards the material you present </s>
<s> evidential disjuncts clearly obviously etc </s>
<s> less common but sometimes useful are </s>
<s> sadly this was the last novel hardy was to write </s>
<s> mediation is the process of acting as a gobetween or guide </s>
<s> mediating devices include phrases like as i have shown above so far i have tried to argue that it may be helpful here to distinguish between in this section in my introductory paragraph etc </s>
<s> overuse of such mediating devices is unwise especially where they involve direct repetition </s>
<s> but you should use a quotation if the language of the original is itself important </s>
<s> tell the reader something about the context from which the quotation was taken to indicate the background against which the quotation is being used </s>

<s> as domatia are found on crops like coffee the phenomenon may be of agricultural significance </s>
<s> the seeds of 50–90 of tropical trees and shrubs are dispersed by vertebrates and much of the vertebrate fauna up to 80 in peru for example is supported by fruit </s>
<s> fruits contrasting in colour with unripe ones or with bracts peduncles or calyces are common and seeds may contrast vividly with their dehisced fruits or be bicoloured the combination of black with red occurs in 18 of all fruit displays in both costa rica and peru whereas red orange white and yellow tend to occur alone </s>

<s> a plant could in theory specialize in a few generalist dispersers just as a frugivore could specialize on a plant dispersed by many other species </s>
<s> there is no theoretical reasoning for supposing that there should be mutual coevolution of dispersers and dispersed plants </s>
<s> on the contrary a wide range of dispersal agents would allow a larger number of individuals to strip the tree of fruit at its prime and it would then be distributed to a wider range of habitats and be buffered against any disaster that might overcome the dispersal agent of a species relying on just one such agent </s>
<s> for example the island of singapore has more native species of palm than has the whole of the african continent </s>
<s> this probably explains why africa is relatively rather poor in specialized frugivorous birds </s>
<s> because fruits have a limited range of presentation possibilities and in many respects mimic one another in attracting birds the frugivorous avifauna is less diversified than the insectivorous </s>
<s> again the insectivores in closely related groups can coexist whereas this is rare in the frugivores </s>
<s> these are features of the early successional plants of clearings and forest edge and in europe would be exemplified by elder sambucus nigra caprifoliaceae with its small shinyblack sweet fruits produced in abundance </s>
<s> as it must be swallowed the layer is not too thick which may account for the common occurrence of relatively thin layers of nutritious material over a single seed or a few seeds in a fruit </s>

<s> the modal fruit in both tropical and temperate regions is a 7–9 mm black or red berry but as there is a greater gape range in tropical birds it is perhaps not surprising to find a wider range of fruit and seed size there </s>
<s> in miconia melastomataceae in an area of forest in trinidad a set of species with such staggered fruiting seasons between them produced available fruit all the year round but among the birddispersed and insectpollinated lauraceae in the lower montane forests of costa rica this was not found although the trees shared many seed dispersers as well as flower visitors </s>
<s> unlike smaller birds which though more numerous go to cover to eat this bird is fearless and defends the tree against other frugivores and may thus on two counts be rather inefficient at promoting dispersal of seeds away from the mother tree </s>
<s> in panama 60 of the seeds from the understorey tree guarea glabra meliaceae were removed by four species of north american migrants though there was no evidence that any single bird species was dependent on the tree for nutrition nor the tree reliant on any one species of bird for dispersal </s>
<s> in the north temperate zone the latitudinal range of fruiting season seems to be associated with the arrival of the southwardshifting migratory frugivorous birds such as thrushes </s>
<s> the birds are small like the fruits and have short rather stout bills quite unlike the specialized frugivores discussed above </s>
<s> the seeds are embedded in a sticky material undigested by the bird s gut and are either voided through the gut or as in mistletoe the sticky seed is scraped off in crevices in bark by the bird which has first removed the fruit structures </s>
<s> parrots and most pigeons for example are notorious seed consumers </s>
<s> palms seem to have a mechanical defence in the form of a woody endocarp familiar as the stone of a date </s>

<s> plants in some 34 families were used in borneo over a period of 16 months and all but 5 were sources of fruit </s>

<s> airdispersal probably accounts for the distributions of some liverworts though many spores are not longlived in a desiccating atmosphere but the presence of certain hepatics on ascension island st helena and tristan da cunha seems to confirm it </s>
<s> however for ectomycorrhizal fungi in southwest australia at least dispersal is by marsupials and germination of spores is unsuccessful unless they have passed through a digestive tract </s>
<s> although parrots have been treated as seed predators they are not always so for they appear to be the principal dispersal agents of seeds of several species of parkia leguminosae in the neotropics as well as certain lecythidaceae there even though they are partly destructive </s>
<s> it may well be that the gum that surrounds the seeds of these species of parkia and not of the seeds of the palaeotropical ones is important here </s>
<s> no other relationship with other insects has yet been demonstrated but much of the fauna may be lost in which case there is some shortterm phylogenetic inertia </s>
<s> the leaves of palms in general are often used for thatching and are relatively durable compared with most tropical foliage </s>
<s> nevertheless these large seeds are rather unlikely to be moved uphill by dispersal agents particularly as there are no large animals on the island where the palm grows </s>
<s> elephants which lack colour vision but have a strong sense of smell and favour large smelly dull fruits are the only animals able to swallow the pyrene of panda oleosa pandaceae and collected seeds do not germinate unless passed through an elephant in whose dung they germinate </s>
<s> an inspired guess was made that the failure of the seeds to germinate was because its seeds had not passed through the gut of the dodo raphus cucullatus extinct since 1681 </s>
<s> by contrast the flexibility of plants as in the examples of the freycinetia and the three kings island flora discussed above in terms of dispersal agents can be seen in two neotropical studies </s>
<s> in short in the context of the modern fauna many trees may appear to represent the living past </s>
<s> early pollinators were attracted by pollen and probably had grinding mandibles they also took ovules and developing seeds </s>
<s> they were probably derived from predominantly predacious groups adapted to seeking pollen which is high in protein and the foraging behaviour of modern predacious insects and pollinators is similar </s>

<s> hummingbirds and hawkmoths are largely associated with trees producing flowers near the forest floor where noctuid moths are found to be important pollinators in the smaller species of meliaceae and butterflies in such families as rubiaceae </s>
<s> almost all the insects examined are generalists particularly small bees that visit a wide range of the trees with rather small unspecialized flowers </s>
<s> in west malaysia there seems to be a clear distinction between the pollinators above and those below the canopy </s>
<s> in the canopy the flowers are larger and more conspicuous as in almost all of the emergents </s>
<s> the pollinators in the lower regions are nonspecific and include meliponid bees solitary wasps and butterflies and also unspecialized beetles midges flies and thrips all rather shortrange pollinators </s>
<s> most of these are also found in the upper canopy although that is dominated by the wideranging bee apis dorsata with xylocopa bees also conspicuous </s>
<s> the trees of the lower reaches are thus generalized in their attractions while trees like the dipterocarps get the local fauna and the bee apis dorsata </s>
<s> possibly such mechanisms can be used to explain where the pollinators come from in speciespoor forests such as the shorea albida forest in sarawak when the dominants flower </s>
<s> the major pollinators are shortdistance generalists and the fidelity is maintained by the simultaneous flowering of trees of both sexes within close proximity </s>
<s> in a species of the palm genus bactris the fleshy petals and sepals are eaten while the fleshy bracts of a species of freycinetia pandanaceae are eaten by birds which are thought to pollinate it </s>
<s> the attraction for the bees may be conditioned or due to taste but it must be noted that nectars contain things besides sugars particularly lipids amino acids and proteins as well as alkaloids nonprotein amino acids and phenols </s>
<s> an example showing that such categorizations and generalizations are perhaps unwise is that of inga vera var spuria leguminosae which is first visited by moths and humming birds high sucrose but 4 hours later produces a sour odour attractive to bats perhaps due to fermentation by microorganisms the resultant diminution of sucrose making the ratio suitable for the bats </s>
<s> several passifloraceae present pollen and nectar at different times of day and share the same pollinators while certain nectarless bignoniaceous lianes mimic nectar producers by flowering at the same time as or just after those that are pollinated </s>

<s> by the time of anthesis there is time for four generations and a single insect can by then have given rise to 4000 juveniles they get trapped between the anthers and the petals as the lowers open and as adults feed on the pollen </s>
<s> they carry on average only 25 grains each and as the corollas fall in the morning they ny back up to the canopy where they effect pollination any slight wind drifting them to other trees </s>
<s> in annona sericea the flowers have thick fleshy petals that never quite open </s>

<s> five angraecoid species were found to share the same pollinator panogena lingens but ethological and mechanical mechanisms apparently restrict interspecific pollination despite mixed pollen loads </s>

<s> as i shall seek to show the political culture remains predominantly an allegiant one and the important question to be addressed is not why has there been a decline in the civic culture but rather why has that decline not been greater </s>
<s> a number of introduction texts on british politics do not have chapters devoted specifically to political history </s>
<s> the omission is a surprising one </s>
<s> they serve also to highlight certain features of the political culture </s>
<s> the early stuart kings james i and charles i sought to assert the doctrine of the divine right of kings and to deny many of the privileges acquired or asserted by parliament </s>
<s> rule by the council of state was succeeded by oliver cromwell s unsuccessful military dictatorship and in 1660 charles son returned to assume the throne as charles ii </s>
<s> relations between the two gradually deteriorated during the reign of charles ii and became severe in the reign of his successor james ii </s>
<s> the monarch thus became formally dependent on parliament for consent to the raising of taxes and for the passage of legislation </s>
<s> not until the twentieth century was the office of prime minister to be mentioned in a statute </s>
<s> a ministry that enjoyed royal confidence could generally take the house of lords for grated and provided it did not prove incompetent or seek to impose excessive taxation its position was unassailable in the commons </s>
<s> after the 1830s the lords tended to be somewhat restrained in their attacks on government measures </s>
<s> the act itself was the product of demands for change because of the limited impact of the 1832 act and because of more immediate political considerations </s>
<s> other significant measures followed in its wake </s>
<s> the effect of the act was to bring into being an electorate in which working men were in a majority </s>
<s> the conservative national union and the national liberal federation were formed in order to facilitate and encourage the support of the new electors </s>
<s> if the votes of working men were to be obtained the parties had to offer them something </s>
<s> and the parties could fulfil their promises only if they presented a uniform program to the electorate and achieved a cohesive majority in the house of commons to carry through that program </s>
<s> the electorate proved too large and too politically unsophisticated to evaluate the merits of an individual mp s behaviour </s>
<s> political parties provided the labels with which electors could identify and elections became gladiatorial contests between parties rather than between individual candidates </s>
<s> the house of commons in effect lost two of the most important functions ascribed to it by bagehot those of legislation and of choosing the government the former passed to the cabinet and the latter to the electorate </s>
<s> the cabinet had previously rested its authority on the support of the house now it derived its authority from the electors </s>
<s> thus within the formal framework of deciding public policy the government was dominant </s>
<s> government began to conceive its duties as extending beyond those of maintaining law and order and of defending the realm </s>
<s> the statute book began to expand with the addition of measures of social reform </s>
<s> they included measures to limit working hours for women and children to improve housing and public health to make education for children compulsory to provide for the safety of workers including the payment of compensation by employers in the event of accidents at work and even to extend the right to strike </s>
<s> politicians fueled rather than played down the belief that britain should become in the words of one politician a land fit for heroes once the war to end all wars was won in other words that provision should be made for those who had fought for king and country </s>
<s> there was a reaction against conservative government unpreparedness for war in the 1930s and against those who had not done more to solve the nation s problems during the depression </s>
<s> as the 1940s progressed there developed a notable movement including within the conservative party for a greater degree of social and economic intervention by government </s>
<s> the liberal government before the first world war had made the first tentative steps in the introduction of oldage pensions 1908 and national health and unemployment insurance 1911 </s>
<s> the interwar years had seen the introduction of a number of significant measures of social reform especially those associated with neville chamberlain as minister of health </s>
<s> he proposed to the cabinet 25 measures and secured the enactment of 21 of them </s>
<s> such producers were encouraged to reduce capacity and maintain prices </s>
<s> the former proposed a comprehensive scheme of social security one to provide social insurance against interruption and destruction of earning power and for special expenditure arising at birth marriage or death </s>
<s> for those who required special help there was national assistance the provision of noncontributory benefits dispensed on the basis of meanstesting </s>
<s> acceptance and usage of techniques pioneered by the economist j m keynes ushered in the managed economy </s>
<s> government accepted responsibility for keeping aggregate monetary demand at a level sufficient to ensure full employment or what was considered as far as possible to constitute full employment an unemployment rate of 1 or 2 was considered acceptable and the annual budget was to be used as the main instrument of economic policy </s>
<s> at the same time it was reluctant to pursue policies that would increase the tax burden or the public sector of the economy </s>
<s> in july 1957 prime minister harold macmillan was able to declare that for most of the people you ve never had it so good </s>
<s> from the foregoing sketch one can recognize not only the features of the political culture outlined in the preceding chapter but also the convergence of those features and their interplay with the experience of history </s>
<s> an empirical orientation to change and a conditional relationship between governors and governed are longstanding characteristics of political life </s>
<s> change has been piecemeal and largely incremental </s>
<s> history and political culture </s>
<s> the reforms of the nineteenth century were facilitated not only by an empirical orientation to change but also by the paternalism of political leaders </s>
<s> noblesse oblige privilege entails responsibility is a foreign phase but it embodies a very british concept </s>
<s> equally important britons have been taught that the political system works </s>
<s> what makes the history of england so eminently valuable wrote t h buckle is that nowhere else has the national progress been so little interfered with either for good or evil </s>
<s> the british have not been alone in such teaching </s>
<s> such calls were to extend into the following decade </s>
<s> charles hardin cited british experience in contending that party government if it can be attained provides the best hope that our government will be able to meet its problems </s>
<s> although not all observers wished to emulate british experience their analyses appeared edged with a touch of envy </s>
<s> in less than 30 years the british economy had declined from being one of the strongest to one of the weakest in europe </s>
<s> government was increasingly constrained by the activities of economically powerful groups both at home and abroad notably in the latter case the international monetary fund </s>
<s> the positive picture of british government began to lose its gloss academics who had previously written about the political system in positive terms now turned their attention to the problem inherent in that system </s>
<s> others have stressed the legacies of former international glory attitudes and institutions derived from the days when britain was at the center of the world economy acting as a barrier to necessary change </s>
<s> as we have seen chapter 1 class did not displace status in british society </s>
<s> low priority was given to industry and science and so the analysis goes a tendency grew for those with wealth and some ability to avoid management in favor of professional pursuits such as the law </s>
<s> prescriptions have included decentralization electoral reform and more radical economic policies </s>
<s> those groups have brought pressure to bear on government to provide resources or pursue policies to the benefit of their members </s>
<s> as a result even though recognizing the need for restraint a group is tempted to raise its own claims </s>
<s> it has fewer benefits to dispense than previously yet is faced with a plethora of interests each of which is unwilling to moderate its demands in the interests of all </s>
<s> the most important of these is that provided by professor beer in his recent work britain against itself </s>
<s> i shall return to these analyses in appropriate chapters responding in particular to beer s sophisticated analysis in the conclusion </s>
<s> for the moment two concluding points need to be made </s>
<s> each approach has its limitations and these i shall seek to draw out at appropriate points in the text </s>
<s> so wide are the analyses and the prescriptions that one is tempted to wonder whether the concept of pluralist stagnation might itself be applied to the political analysis of britain s ills </s>
<s> the problem is not primarily a structural one structures are dependent variables </s>
<s> the orientations of the political culture identified in the preceding chapter remain </s>
<s> my conclusion will not necessarily be an optimistic one it will emphasize potential rather than expectation but it will lack the negative connotations attached to the foregoing analyses </s>
<s> the united states constitution is considered by americans to embody the principles of a higher law to constitute in fact imperfect man s most perfect rendering of what blackstone saluted as the eternal immutable laws of good and evil to which the creator himself in all his dispensations conforms and which he has enabled human reason to discover so far as they are necessary for the conduct of human actions </s>
<s> there are certain principles that are clearly at the heart of the constitution parliamentary sovereignty being the prime example but there are many provisions be they expressed through statute law or the writings of constitutional experts that are of constitutional significance but on which there is no clear agreement that they form part of the british constitution </s>
<s> in seeking to interpret the constitution the courts may have recourse to works by constitutional experts </s>
<s> it provides the main source for the partwritten element of the constitution </s>
<s> they are published in authoritative written form and as acts of parliament are interpreted by the courts </s>
<s> although many prerogative powers have been displaced by statute many matters at the heart of government are still determined under the authority of the prerogative </s>
<s> by convention such powers are normally exercised formally by the monarch on the advice of ministers the ministers in practice take the decisions </s>
<s> they are limited to the interpretation of provisions of acts of parliament </s>
<s> even in exercising their power of interpretations they are limited by rules of interpretation and by precedent </s>
<s> the exception is the house of lords the highest domestic court of appeal which is not now bound by its previous decisions </s>
<s> they are so to speak the oil in the forma machinery of the constitution </s>
<s> they help fill the gap between the constitutional formality and the political reality </s>
<s> for example ministers are responsible formally to the monarch </s>
<s> because of the political changes wrought in the nineteenth century they are by convention responsible now also to parliament </s>
<s> by convention the government of the day resigns or requests a dissolution if a motion of no confidence is carried against it in the house of commons </s>
<s> queen victoria in the nineteenth century contemplated refusing her assent to a measure but wiser counsels prevailed </s>
<s> for the queen to refuse her assent to a measure passed by the two houses of parliament would draw her into the realms of political controversy hence jeopardizing the claim of the monarch to be above politics </s>
<s> for ministers to ignore parliament completely would prove equally untenable </s>
<s> the statements of their writers are presumed to be evidence of judicial decisions that have been lost and are therefore accepted if not contrary to reason </s>
<s> such conventions are prescribed neither by statute nor by judicial interpretation so one must study instead scholarly interpretations of political behaviour and practice </s>
<s> especially important authoritative works in the nineteenth century were those by john austin and a v dicey </s>
<s> works of authority can be rewritten or subjected to different interpretations in the same way as can other texts </s>
<s> much the same can be said about constitutionally significant statute law judicial decisions and works of authority in the united states </s>
<s> as may be surmised from the foregoing there is no single body endowed with the responsibility for interpreting the provisions of the constitution </s>
<s> as in the united states statute and common law are subject to judicial interpretation but there is no power of judicial review at least not as the term is understood in the united states </s>
<s> the courts can not declare a legislative measure or an executive action contrary to the provisions of the constitution </s>
<s> by virtue of the concept of parliamentary sovereignty the act would be definitive </s>
<s> the central provisions of the constitution are listed in table 41 parliamentary sovereignty the rule of law a unitary as opposed to a federal system and what i have termed parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy </s>
<s> while some critics have considered them weak and unnecessary pillars supporting a crumbing edifice they remain crucial to an understanding of the british constitution </s>
<s> it came to occupy a unique place in constitutional law </s>
<s> its underpinnings are not only legal but also political and historical </s>
<s> dicey himself argued that it comprised at least three distinct though kindred conceptions that no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary courts of the land that no man is above the law and every man whatever be his rank or condition is subject to the ordinary law of the realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals and that the general principles of the constitution are the result of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons in particular cases brought before the courts </s>
<s> parliament could if it so wishes confer arbitrary powers upon government </s>
<s> indeed many observers would argue that given the growth of cabinet government the potential for government to seek and receive such powers is significantly greater now than was the case at the time when dicey was writing </s>
<s> so long as parliamentary sovereignty remains the one fundamental law of the constitution there is no way in which substantive rights can be entrenched and put beyond the reach of parliament </s>
<s> the third feature of the constitution that i have listed that the united kingdom is a unitary state is a less difficult one to comprehend </s>
<s> ireland entered into legislative union in 1801 </s>
<s> excluded from the irish free state were the northern six counties of ireland forming part of the traditional region of ulster </s>
<s> it is presided over by the prime minister </s>
<s> by convention ministers are drawn from parliament and again by convention predominantly from the elected house the house of commons </s>
<s> although the government is no longer chosen by the commons it nonetheless is elected through the house of commons there is no separate election of the executive </s>
<s> there is a separation and overlap of powers between the government and the house of commons in britain but no equivalent separation of personnel </s>
<s> government ministers are drawn from and remain within parliament </s>
<s> the cabinet is similarly responsible to parliament through the convention of collective ministerial responsibility </s>
<s> in drawing up measures it is aided primarily by its officials that is civil servants and will consult normally with interested bodies such consultation though enjoys no formal recognition in constitutional terms </s>
<s> the house is expected to submit bills to sustained scrutiny and debate before giving its assent to them or not giving its assent to them but the influence of party usually precludes such an outcome </s>
<s> in practice it is rare for the lords to reject government measures and there is a gentleman s agreement among the parties in the house that a bill promised in a government s election manifesto should be given an unopposed second reading see chapter 11 </s>
<s> by convention this assent is always forthcoming </s>
<s> queen victoria contemplated such refusal but was persuaded otherwise </s>
<s> in certain extreme circumstances her majesty may find herself in a position in which she is called on to use her discretion in making a political decision </s>
<s> the electorate may have the power to choose the members of the house of commons but the will of the electorate is not something formally recognized by the courts </s>
<s> the courts recognize and will enforce only acts of parliament </s>
<s> previously the period was seven years </s>
<s> the ability of a prime minister effectively to call a general election has been regarded by some writers as the most important weapon in ensuring parliamentary support </s>
<s> it would be exceptional albeit not unknown for mps of the government party to vote against their own side on a vote of confidence </s>
<s> in summary then the fourth element of the constitution parliamentary government under a constitutional monarch may be seen to comprise different relationships and powers </s>
<s> as we shall see to understand british politics fully one has also to go beyond that framework </s>
<s> others are less easy to classify </s>
<s> such a reaction is both natural and understandable the constitution does exhibit those very characteristics </s>
<s> the conventions of the constitution as professor lemay observed have meaning only when they are looked at against a background of continuous political change </s>
<s> it is very difficult to say with certainty what they were at any particular moment </s>
<s> above all they can not be understood with the politics left out </s>
<s> there is as we shall see pressure from many influential sources for the constitution not only to be further amended but also to be radically altered </s>
<s> in the united kingdom a citizen may have the opportunity to vote in a national election only once every five years </s>
<s> the members of the house of lords are not elected they serve by virtue of birth or for life peers by appointment for life </s>
<s> there are no primaries candidate selection is an internal matter for the parties </s>
<s> on polling day the elector is faced with a small ballot slip on which are printed the names usually of only three or four candidates six or more candidates standing in any one constituency would be unusual </s>
<s> the new cabinet and other ministerial appointments are announced within a matter of days sometimes within a matter of hours </s>
<s> these are fixed terms and the elector has the chance to vote for members of councils at district and county or metropolitan levels and sometimes at parish level as well </s>

<s> once they have completed their work their recommendations are presented to a government minister the home secretary who is then required to lay them before the house of commons for approval </s>
<s> as a result the 1970 general election was not fought on the basis of the new boundaries recommended by the boundary commissioners </s>
<s> in 1979 the electoral quota for english constituencies was a little under 70000 </s>
<s> the isle of wight an english constituency had an electorate of 94768 while the scottish constituency of the western isles difficult to enlarge for geographic reasons had but 22901 electors </s>
<s> the campaign is fought in practice on a national level between the two main parties the candidates and the local campaigns serving to reinforce the national campaigns of their leaders </s>
<s> candidates are selected locally by the parties and the parties provide the finance and the organization for the campaign </s>
<s> there are certain types of expenditure that are illegal for example paying an elector to exhibit an election poster or paying for voters to be taken to and from the polling booths and separate committees to promote a candidate are not permitted </s>
<s> each candidate is permitted one postagefree mailing of one piece of election literature </s>
<s> the broadcasts themselves are often regarded by voters as the least appetizing part of election campaigns </s>
<s> the basis of the parties appeal to the country is the election manifestos that they issue </s>
<s> they constitute a topic of some controversy </s>
<s> a more relevant criticism is that manifesto promises may not address themselves to the country s real problems </s>
<s> the exclusion of certain clergy is less easy to justify a relic of the time when religious disputes were at the heart of national affairs as is the exclusion of 18 to 20yearolds when the voting age was lowered in 1969 the age of eligibility for candidature was not </s>
<s> in britain unlike the united states there are no residence requirements hence parties enjoy a wider range of choice in the selection of candidates </s>

<s> in scotland there is the challenge of the scottish national party </s>
<s> the ecology party fielded 109 candidates in 1983 up from 53 in 1979 the rightwing national front 60 candidates though down from its 1979 peak of 303 candidates the british national party a breakaway movement from the national front 54 candidates and the communist party 35 candidates </s>
<s> all the candidates of these parties lost their deposits as did a few scattered independents and other candidates standing under rather esoteric banners </s>
<s> in 1983 for example there was a justice for divorced fathers candidate one representing freddie s alternative medicine party and another standing for law and order in gotham city a label derived from the old batman comic book series </s>
<s> the candidates of the main parties are selected locally though the national party in each case retains some veto power </s>
<s> a local party may choose someone not on the list but it must obtain approval from the national party for its choice </s>
<s> this committee will sift through the applications and the recommend three or more names to the executive council the main decisionmaking body of the association </s>
<s> he has a nice name was one comment made during the selection deliberations the response a polite no </s>
<s> because wives are looked on a surrogates for their husbands while the latter are at westminster their attitudes to constituency work and their appearance are considered important </s>
<s> nominations may be made by local ward committees party groups such as the women s section and by affiliated organizations principally affiliated trade unions </s>
<s> instead a full selection procedure was to be gone through during the lifetime of a parliament thus allowing other aspiring candidates to be considered </s>
<s> in the liberal party selection is by the local party also with the national party maintaining an approved list of candidates </s>
<s> within the social democratic party sdp candidate selection is made through the area parties </s>
<s> what this means is that the candidate receiving more votes than any other candidate is declared elected </s>
<s> it is the same method as that employed in senate and house elections in the united states </s>
<s> examples of constituency results from the 1983 general election are given in table 53 </s>
<s> in practice most seats are considered to be safe seats for one or other of the two main parties that is the winning candidate has been returned with a majority that represents 10 or more of the votes cast </s>
<s> of those who voted virtually all voted for either the conservative or labour parties 3 </s>
<s> the most significant predictor of party voting was class </s>
<s> the third generalization is drawn from survey data </s>
<s> class clearly was not an exclusive predictor nor was the relationship between class and party symmetrical the middle class was more conservative than the working class was labour </s>
<s> by october 1974 barely half of the electorate identified let alone voted with their natural class party </s>
<s> the relative decline in the importance of class is borne out by a survey of voters in the 1983 election table 55 </s>
<s> the gap between its share of the manual and nonmanual votes was only 21 compared with 27 in 1979 and 40 in 1959 </s>
<s> this decline could support the generational cohort theory developed by butler and stokes that is that it is not age as such that influences voting behaviour but the period at which one becomes politically aware </s>
<s> as a predictor of voting behaviour though age is of marginal utility and so too is gender </s>
<s> traditionally women have been somewhat more likely than men to vote conservative </s>
<s> in most postwar elections more men have voted labour than have voted conservative whereas more women have voted conservative than have voted labour </s>
<s> however the bias was a slight one </s>
<s> the disparity in the data highlights the marginal significance now of gender as a predictor of voting behaviour </s>
<s> in a good postwar election year the conservatives would normally expect to pick up a respectable number of seats in northern england and to some extent in scotland </s>
<s> this is no longer the case </s>
<s> mrs thatcher carried her party to victory in 1979 largely on the votes of the electorate in the southern half of england below a line drawn from the river severn to the wash see map 51 </s>
<s> a mori poll conducted in 1981 found that among skilled workers in the north of england labour had a 32 lead over the conservatives </s>
<s> in some cities the decline in support has been dramatic </s>
<s> these changes have been attributed to changing economic patterns </s>
<s> prosperity would also appear relevant to the increasing importance of home ownership </s>
<s> increasingly then the conservative party is becoming a party that draws its support predominantly from the south of england from the rural and suburban constituencies and from homeowners </s>
<s> as for the liberalsdp alliance it appears to draw its support fairly evenly from the different classes table 55 from different parts of the country though marginally more from the south than from the north and scotland and from owneroccupiers as well as councilhouse tenants table 57 </s>
<s> against this the conservatives were preferred by far greater margins on the issues of defense and prices </s>
<s> that system was both perceived and expected to perform three related functions through election to the house of commons it was expected to produce a government through a purportedly democratic franchise and mode of election it was expected to confer legitimacy upon the government to govern subject to the approval of parliament and through facilitating a choice between parties propounding specific programs it was expected to influence public policy the party in government carrying through the promises embodies in its election manifesto </s>
<s> the current debate </s>
<s> the conservative party achieved a swing of 52 in its favor in the may 1979 election being returned with a majority of 43 seats </s>
<s> the effects of this adversary relationship on public policy in terms of both continuity and substance was considered to threaten rather than enhance the effectiveness of government </s>
<s> the disparity in the size of constituency electorates meant that a vote cast in a constituency with a small electorate such as glasgow central was worth more than one cast in say bromsgrove and redditch </s>
<s> the two most central criticisms though have been directed at the aggregate effects of such a method of election </s>
<s> given the difference in the spread of support between the parties it is possible for one party to get more votes than its opponent party but receive fewer seats </s>
<s> in the february 1974 election the position was reversed the conservatives winning more votes nationally than labour but labour winning more seats </s>
<s> the largest party by contrast can top the poll in most constituencies with say 40 of the poll the remaining votes split among the other party candidates see the example of leicester south in table 53 thus achieving a majority of seats without receiving an absolute majority of the votes cast </s>
<s> the other more recent criticisms of the electoral system has derived from the characterization of the existing political system as an adversary one </s>
<s> policy discontinuity frustrated industrialists and investors who wished to engage in forward planning they could not anticipate stability in government programs </s>
<s> in order to win an election a party would make extravagant promises doing so in order to outbid the other party </s>
<s> this would likely involve one of the main parties having to cooperate with a party or parties taking a more central stance </s>
<s> hence leading to greater moderation in policy </s>
<s> however there would be additional seats allocated to parties on a regional basis a minimum of 5 of the vote in any area of allocation being necessary to obtain any additional seats </s>
<s> the conservative and labour par ties have witnessed the creation of bodies within their own ranks favoring such reform </s>
<s> given the reformers argument that pr would enhance the likelihood of coalition government consent could be undermined if government was to result from postelection bargaining between parties by a small center party holding the balance of power and hence wielding undue influence over government policy and by the alienation of voters who support a party excluded on a longterm basis from becoming a partner in coalition </s>
<s> some observers have drawn attention to the fact that such assumptions themselves rest on flimsy foundations </s>
<s> there may be some discontinuity in policy occasioned by governments of different political persuasions pursuing different paths but that is the price an acceptable price one has to pay for the advantages offered by the existing system </s>
<s> such a line of argument is pursued especially by the two largest parties </s>
<s> it operates on the principle of one person one vote but there is now some dispute as to its legitimacy and that of the government it produces on the grounds that the principle of one person one vote one value has not been fully realized </s>
<s> whether britain will witness electoral reform in the next decade or so rests on the outcome of that debate </s>
<s> a possible taxonomy of deictic elements and terms follows which modifies and builds on previous attempts by linguists such as levinson 1983 </s>
<s> the relation between these elements and terms and the lyric poem is then discussed </s>
<s> the inclusion of the notion of subjectivity in the above definition might seem surprising here but i am not equating deixis with a concept that stands in rough opposition to objectivity </s>
<s> any utterance relates both to the speaker s centre and to the surrounding cognitive environment </s>
<s> in order to clarify this i should like to begin by making a distinction between deictic terms and deictic elements </s>
<s> the progressive form would be a more likely occurrence if an immediate moment is being referred to </s>
<s> this is a rather complex issue but clearly there are elements of language notably deictics which are not accessible to a purely truthconditional semantics </s>
<s> if semantics is modified to take account of deixis it becomes a contextconditional semantics and the boundary between semantics and pragmatics becomes very blurred </s>
<s> at this point the problem of context itself comes to the fore </s>
<s> it is possible to see context functioning in three ways </s>
<s> point 3 states that certain linguistic elements encode contextual features </s>
<s> these i suggest are deictic elements and terms </s>
<s> i reject 1 because this can not take account of the vast range of human communication which does not take place within the canonical situation of utterance ie facetoface </s>
<s> this according to bühler 1934 is where other deictic aids replace the finger </s>
<s> he sees the possibility of a nonegocentric deixis operating </s>
<s> i have isolated a specific discoursal site where deixis can be discerned operating </s>
<s> demonstratives are described in terms of relative proximity to the encoder this is proximal that is distal </s>
<s> the initial clause happy those early days plunges us into the middle of a discourse as much lyric poetry does </s>
<s> early is deictic here but only inasmuch as it sets up an opposition to a notional late </s>
<s> a demonstrative is used to refer to a temporal aspect </s>
<s> the opening of a poem is obviously important because there is no previous discourse through which to interpret it except for the title but this is not precise enough to enable us to assign the proper indexical meaning to the deictic elements and terms </s>
<s> so how does the concept of context function here in relation to the deictic elements and terms which are clearly organising the poem s reference structure </s>
<s> a powerful deictic centre is being mobilised without an immediate situation </s>
<s> it will further engage in the set of those possible worlds and alter the context depending on the interaction of the conditions which specify the action of the discourse coordinates </s>
<s> this recurs in the expression this place appointed for my second race lines 3 4 </s>
<s> they tend to suggest homophoric or anaphoric reference although their function is not straightforward </s>
<s> the subsequent information is in fact redundant with respect to deictic function </s>
<s> i have stressed that we construct a context from the deixis of the text a context being the set of possibilities which exist in the universe of discourse and situation of utterance for the interpretation of the utterance but the initial elements of the utterance must be more dense in terms of pragmatic activity </s>
<s> my first example of this was the opening line </s>
<s> the article is unmarked as regards spatiotemporal relations so the function of deictic reference is to set up a continual spatial temporal and subjective opposition between proximal and distal relations </s>
<s> if we go one further stage in this direction we reach the metacontextual concept of relevance </s>
<s> what kind of speaker is presupposed to be uttering happy those early dayes </s>
<s> the poetic voice or persona is a recognisable postrenaissance phenomenon </s>
<s> as a final example i return to wordsworth s poem nutting </s>
<s> the poem is too long to quote in its entirety here but the opening lines should provide a suitable contrast with the retreate here a particular incident in the past is being recalled so the bulk of the poem has a content time which is separate from the coding time </s>
<s> the present tense and modality of seems in the opening line combine to compound the present and the past the content time and the coding time </s>
<s> subsequent references to wordsworth s surroundings are made with the definite article the woods the pathless rocks </s>
<s> the omission of the verb gives an immediacy which would be missing from a construction such as it is a virgin scene where the present tense is a direct attempt to make a coding time and content time the same </s>
<s> it is the same and we should not be surprised at this in ordinary discourse </s>

<s> if as some israeli moderates argue terrorism always was a marginal question it is certainly infinitely less serious for israel s future than the mass popular unrest of the intifada but by continuing to lump everything they can such as children throwing stones under its general rubric the extremists seek to delegitimise the intifada and evade any necessity for looking at its real causes </s>
<s> it is completely and increasingly normal for soldiers to break into houses and mix food with cement to leave excrement lying around to turn the male population out in the middle of the night to clean the streets and sprinkle them with rose water </s>
<s> but is hardly less distressing to israeli moderates not merely because they find oppression of another people morally wrong but because of its dangerously divisive effect on israeli society itself </s>
<s> there will be no terrorism palestinians forecast and no systematic armed struggle against israeli soldiers but there will probably be a growth in occasional selective operations like the recent killing of two soldiers in gaza intended to add a judicious edge of real pain to the innocuous rebellion of the stones </s>
